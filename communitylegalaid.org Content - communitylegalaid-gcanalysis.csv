The Court is a very traditional place. When you are representing yourself in Court, you are trying to persuade a judge that you are right. So you must act, dress and speak in a way that helps you with your case. Here are some tips:

BE ON TIME

What will happen if you are late?


	Your case can be dismissed
	The judge may make a decision without hearing your side


What to do if you are late?


	Call the Court ask to speak with the clerk of the Judge assigned to your case. Ask the secretary to tell the Judge why you are late &amp; when you expect to arrive.
	The message may not get to the judge on time. The judge may decide you do not have a good reason to be late. So try not to be late.


DRESS NEATLY


	You do not need fancy clothes; just make sure you are neat and clean.
	Tank tops, shorts, or ripped jeans are not acceptable. T‑shirts or hats with messages such as “Legalize Marijuana” or “Where’s the Beef,” while funny, are not acceptable for court
	Do not wear hats
	There will be a security check so leave concealed-carry weapon, etc. at home.


BE RESPECTFUL


	How you act is as important as how you look. Just like an attorney, you must be respectful to everyone in the Court including the judge, court staff and the other party involved in your case.
	Do not speak while others are speaking. Do not argue with the other side. If you disagree with what the other side is saying, wait until he or she is done and then tell the Judge.
	Speak to the judge only when you are told it is your turn. Address the judge as “your honor.” Never interrupt the Judge.
	Try to control your emotions as much as possible, especially anger.


DO NOT BRING CHILDREN WITH YOU TO COURT


	In a custody or visitation case you may be requested to bring your child if the Judge, Magistrate or your lawyer requests it. In all other cases, find someone to look after your child.


NO CELL PHONES IN THE COURT


	Turn your phone off when you enter the court. Ringing phones are very distracting. It may make the judge mad which will not help your case!


What to Expect When You Arrive at the Courthouse

Check in at the clerk’s office to find out which courtroom to go to. Go into the courtroom. Sit quietly until your case is called. You may have to wait, be patient.


	If you are late, go up and let the clerk or bailiff know that you have arrived.
	When your case is called, walk to the table or podium for lawyers in front and stand facing the judge. The judge will tell you when to speak.
	When the judge asks you to present your case, tell the judge what it is that you are requesting and why you are requesting it. After you are finished, the other side will have a chance to ask you questions.
	Next, the other side will present his/her case. Don’t forget, if you disagree with something the other side says, do not interrupt. You will have an opportunity to ask the other side questions when he/she is finished talking.
	During the hearing the judge may ask you questions.
	If you don’t understand the question, say so. Don’t answer until you fully understand the question.
	If you don’t know the answer, say so. Don’t be afraid to admit that you don’t know something.
	Decisions are not always given right away. In most cases, you will receive the judge’s decision in the mail within two weeks.


WARNINGS

Do not try to talk to the judge about your case before your case is called.

The law prevents the judge from talking to one party if the other party is not present (unless the case is currently before the court). This one-sided conversation is called an ‘ex parte communication’ and it is illegal.

Any letter, motion or request you send to the court will be ignored by the judge (because it is an ex parte communication) unless you send a copy of that letter or request to the opposing party as well.

For example: If you write to the judge requesting that the court date for your hearing be changed, you must send a copy of this letter to the opposing side or their attorney, if they have one, and let the judge know that you have done this. Otherwise the judge will not even read your letter.

Do not ask court staff for legal advice.

Court staff are not attorneys and cannot provide legal advice. More importantly, they are employees of the court and must treat both sides in a case fairly. It is unfair and illegal for them to help one party and not the other.

Court staff can answer questions about court procedure, court rules, and the meaning of certain legal terms.

129,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/155,A Guide to Self-Advocacy-DNP,,,Attorneys / Legal Services,"What is self-advocacy?

Self-advocacy means speaking up for yourself and taking charge of your life so you can handle your own problems and make sure you get the results you need.

Why would you want to be a self-advocate?

Many people face serious legal problems such as eviction, credit problems, problems with Medicaid or Medicare and utility shut-offs. As a self-advocate, you will know what needs to be done to take care of these legal problems and many other problems before they become too serious.

How can you become a self-advocate?

You can become a self-advocate by following a four-step process. The steps are easy to follow and will bring you success as you take control of your life and take charge of getting what you need. The four steps to self-advocacy are:

Step 1: Be Organized

Step 2: Develop a Plan of Action

Step 3: Take Action

Step 4: Ask for Assistance When Needed

Step 1: Be Organized

Keep all important papers.

Be sure to keep:


	Documents from a court or a lawyer
	All pieces of paper sent to you by a welfare agency
	All rent receipts with landlord’s name, signature and amount paid
	Any contract you’ve signed
	Bank agreements
	Records of money you paid, receipts, band statements, cancelled checks
	Pay stubs
	Tax returns
	Marriage licenses
	Birth certificates and social security cards for yourself and your children
	Copies of letters sent by you to anyone


Keep a record of all important phone calls.

Make sure to write down the:


	Name of the person (very important!)
	Date
	Name of the organization
	What the person told you to do
	What the person promised to do and by when.


Keep your papers and records organized.

Use a folder to get organized:


	Group your papers and records under names like House or Medical.
	Within each group, organize your papers by date. Start with the most recent.


Step 2: Develop a Plan for Action

Focus on the problem and what you need to happen. Take some time when you can work without interruptions.

Write down the possible solutions to the problem that will get you the results you need.

Write down all ideas without judging.

Choose the option that works best for you to get the results you need.

Keep your list of alternative ideas or solutions to use in case your first plan does not work.

Step 3: Take Action

Be prepared! Before you call someone or meet with someone about your problem:


	Focus on why you are taking action and what you need from the person you are contacting.
	Have the important papers and records with you that the person you are contacting will need in order to help you resolve your problem.
	Know what your next step will be if the person you contact cannot get you the results you need. (refer to your Action Plan)
	Ask the name of people you are speaking with.


Be Calm! Don’t let your emotions get in the way of getting what you need. Don’t accuse, insult or yell. You will be able to convince the person you are contacting to help you get what you need if you are willing to listen and remain calm while explaining your problem. (Remember, you can get more bees with honey than vinegar.)

Don’t give up! Speak up and ask questions. Make sure you will get what you need. If you are not getting what you need, ask to speak to a supervisor. If the supervisor is not helping you, speak to the supervisor’s supervisor.

Step 4: Ask for Assistance When Needed

Think of your support networks—family, friends, church and community organizations.

130,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/157,If You are Being Sued and Can't Afford a Lawyer: Filing an Answer,"Pro Se
Representing Yourself",,Attorneys / Legal Services,"What is an ‘Answer’?

If you disagree with a plaintiff’s statement in their complaint that you owe money, you must file what is known as an ‘Answer.’&nbsp; An Answer is your written response to a plaintiff’s statement that you owe him money.&nbsp; It must be filed in Court.

What is a ‘Counterclaim’?&nbsp;

If you feel the plaintiff owes you money, you must file a ‘Counterclaim.”&nbsp; A Counterclaim is your written statement that the plaintiff owes you money.&nbsp; If you want to file both an Answer and a Counterclaim, you can write them out on the same paper.&nbsp; This will be your ‘Answer and Counterclaim.’

It is very important that you file your Answer and any Counterclaim you may have on time.&nbsp; If you do not file on time, the plaintiff may be able to get a ‘Default Judgment’ against you winning the case.&nbsp; The plaintiff could garnish your wages or put a lien on your&nbsp; property.

When to File

You have twenty-eight (28) days from the date you received the court papers to file your Answer and/or Counterclaim.&nbsp; If the last day of the 28-day period falls on a Saturday, Sunday or national holiday, you have until the next business day to file.&nbsp; If you don’t remember when you received your papers, call the Clerk of Courts (the phone number is located on the Summons).&nbsp; Tell them your case number and that you need to know the date your complaint was served.&nbsp; Your case number is at the top, right-hand side of the papers you received.

Where to File

After you have completed your Answer and/or Counterclaim, you must file it at the Clerk of Courts office within the 28 days.&nbsp; It will not cost you any money to file an Answer.&nbsp; You can call the clerk to find out the cost to file a counterclaim.

You should make at least two copies of your Answer and/or Counterclaim.&nbsp; Take the Answer and/or Counterclaim and copies to the Clerk of Courts.&nbsp; Ask them to ‘time-stamp’ them for you.&nbsp; The clerk will keep the original for the court and give you back the copies.&nbsp; One copy is for your records.&nbsp; You must send the other copy to the attorney representing the plaintiff, or, if the person does not have an attorney, to the person who signed the complaint.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; be sure that you state in the Answer and/or Counterclaim that you are sending a copy to either the attorney or the plaintiff.)

If you cannot file your Answer and Counterclaim within the 28 days, then you are entitled to request a “Leave to Plead.”&nbsp; The “Leave to Plead” must be filed by the last day you would have had to file your Answer and Counterclaim.&nbsp; It must be filed within 28 days from the day you received the court papers.&nbsp; The “Leave to Plead” is a written statement by you to the court that you will file your Answer and/or Counterclaim within 30 additional days.&nbsp; If you file a “Leave to Plead,” your Answer and/or Counterclaim must be filed by the end of the 30-day extension you requested in your “Leave to Plead.”

Remember, if you do not file your answer and/or Counterclaim on time, the plaintiff or his attorney will probably try to get a “default judgment” against you.&nbsp; A “default judgment” is a decision by the court in favor of the plaintiff because you did not file your answer on time.&nbsp; You may not receive a copy of the default judgment if you have not filed a written response with the court.&nbsp; The court will normally give the plaintiff a judgment for the amount of money in the plaintiff’s complaint.&nbsp; Therefore, it is very important that you file your Answer and/or Counterclaim with the Clerk of Courts on time.

What to File with the Court: &nbsp;the Answer and/or Counterclaim

Your Answer and/or Counterclaim is your response to the plaintiff’s Complaint.&nbsp; In the Answer, you are telling the court why you do not owe either any money or the entire amount of money the plaintiff is asking for in his complaint.&nbsp; If there are reasons why the plaintiff owes you money, then you should also file a Counterclaim.&nbsp; Be sure to put the case name and case number on your Answer and/or Counterclaim.

Your Answer will generally contain the following information:

1) A heading to identify your case naming the plaintiff and defendant including the case number as well as the name of the court where the case is filed.

2) A statement that you admit or deny that you owe either any money to the plaintiff or that you owe the entire amount of money the plaintiff is requesting.

3) Any reason you may have that you do not owe either all or part of the money.

Your Counterclaim is your claim against the plaintiff.&nbsp; Your claims may include any reason that you feel the plaintiff owes you money or services.

For each of the claims in your Counterclaim, you must state the amount of money your claim is worth.&nbsp; Be reasonable.

Preparing for the Trail

After you have filed your Answer and/or Counterclaim, the court should send you a notice of the time and the place of your trial.&nbsp; If you move after filing your answer/counterclaim, you should give the court your new address in writing.&nbsp; You must appear on time for the trial or the court may dismiss your case against the plaintiff and give the plaintiff everything he is asking for in his case against you.

If you can, try to bring to the trial witnesses who have ‘personal knowledge’ of the facts about the claims you are making against the plaintiff.&nbsp; Personal knowledge means that the witness has actually seen the things or actually heard the conversations that they are testifying about at the trial.&nbsp; You might have to subpoena your witnesses.&nbsp; A “subpoena” is a court order that the person has to come to court.&nbsp; Be careful not to subpoena someone who will actually try to hurt your case.&nbsp; If you need them to bring documents they have in their possession, you must describe in your subpoena what you want them to bring with them.&nbsp; Subpoenas can be obtained at the office of the Clerk of Courts.

You will often need physical documents such as:


	Copies of receipts for money you have spent
	Copies of any agreements you have made in writing
	Copies of bills you have received
	Copies of letters you sent or received about the dispute


You should take the original documents with you to court, along with copies.&nbsp; The court will keep a copy for the court file.

Getting an Attorney to Represent You.

It is always&nbsp; better to be represented by an attorney.&nbsp; This handout does provide some basic information that you should find useful if you are unable to get an attorney and you have no other choice but to represent yourself.

Week long program to assist potential clients, celebrate Pro Bono month

Community Legal Aid is offering another way for clients to receive legal assistance this month. The organization will host its second annual Call for Change telethon from Oct. 24 through 28, where clients can call and receive assistance from a volunteer attorney.

The event is one way Legal Aid is celebrating Pro Bono month during October.

“Last year, we had over 100 clients served in one day,” shared Jennifer van Dulmen, managing attorney for Legal Aid’s family law practice and volunteer legal services program (VLSP). “It was such an overwhelming response, so we are expanding this year.”

To register, any low-income individual or family can call Legal Aid this week. Intake representatives will be available to screen applicants, check availability, and schedule clients for a time to speak with a volunteer attorney.&nbsp;

Legal Aid has been working the past several weeks to line up pro bono attorneys. During the week-long event, volunteers talk to clients, giving basic advice on legal problems, and recommend any follow-up that may be needed.

“They can volunteer as much or as little as they way,” explained Jodi Roberts, a paralegal with Legal Aid’s VLSP. “They just tell us their county and service area of preference. We do all the screening and scheduling, and we do all the follow-up.”

In addition to managing the intake and follow-up, Legal Aid is also offering an optional training webinar to attorneys who have signed up. Two hour-long sessions will be held tomorrow, one at 10:00 a.m. and one at 1:00 p.m.

This event is just one way that Legal Aid’s VLSP program aims to help those in need in central northeast Ohio, van Dulmen explained. Due to cuts in funding in recent years, the organization is only able to serve roughly half of its eligible clients through staffed attorneys.

“For every one person helped with Legal Aid, one is turned away due to lack of resources,” she shared. “VLSP is our answer.”

How to register

Clients wishing to sign up can do so by calling the HelpLine at (800) 998-9454. Screening specialist will be available Monday and Wednesday, 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and Tuesday and Thursday, 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.

Attorneys wishing to volunteer their time to help with this cause may contact the VLSP team at (330) 983-2671 or at vlsp@communitylegalaid.org.

9,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/11,Avoiding Bank Account Attachment,Non-wage Garnishment,,Consumer,"If a judgment is taken against you in court, the winner of the case (the judgment creditor) will try to collect from you. The law gives the judgment creditor the right to collect in several ways. Often there’s nothing you can do about it. By the time there is a judgment, the court has already decided that you owe the money.

However, the law will not allow a judgment creditor to take everything you own. Some property or assets are exempt from collection efforts. If the judgment creditor goes after these, he will not be able to take them. Among the property that is exempt from collection are most kinds of government benefits, including Social Security, SSI, and Unemployment and Workers Compensation. Even though money from these benefits may be in your bank account, they are still exempt if you can prove where they came from. If your benefits are direct-deposited, your monthly bank statements will show the direct deposit and source of the funds.

To be sure the bank account will be totally exempt; it should not have money in it from any other source. For example, if you get a gift of money, spend it on a needed item and do not deposit it in your direct deposit account.

When the judgment creditor asks a bank to freeze all accounts in your name, the bank will do just that. If your name is on someone else’s account, that account will also be frozen. It may be difficult to get the account released. It may cause considerable trouble for the other person who is the real owner of the account while the funds are frozen. But even if the account is released quickly, there may be a bank service charge imposed against the account.

You should think twice about having your name on any account that really isn’t your money. If you expect to need access to someone else’s account, ask the bank if you can sign a signature card to have access, but not have your name listed as a co-owner of the account. If that can not be done, the account owner can give you a power-of-attorney to make deposits and withdrawals from the account.

Another possible alternative to avoid attempted bank attachments is to notify the bank that your funds are exempt and ask the bank to identify your account as having exempt funds in case an attachment order comes in.

A final option is to notify the attorney for the judgment creditor that your income is exempt from attachment. You can file a Notice of Exempt Funds with the court and the attorney at the time a complaint for money judgment is filed against you. You can send a Notice of Exempt Funds to the attorney for the judgment creditor at any point.

Remember to keep a copy of whatever you mail, and note the date, time, and person you talked to for any business you conduct by telephone.

10,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/12,Bankruptcy Basics,Bankruptcy,,Consumer,"What can bankruptcy do for me?&nbsp;

Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding in federal court to stop debt collection until the debts are sorted out according to law. &nbsp;Bankruptcy may:


	Eliminate the legal obligation to pay most or all of your debts to give you a fresh financial start. This is called a “discharge'' of debts.
	Stop foreclosure on your house.&nbsp; Allow you to catch up missed payments.
	Prevent repossession or force a creditor to return repossessed property.
	Stop wage garnishment, bank attachment, and similar debt collection actions.
	Restore or prevent termination of utility service.


What bankruptcy cannot do &nbsp;

It can’t fix all credit problems.&nbsp; It usually cannot:


	Eliminate certain rights of creditors holding debt secured with a mortgage or lien.&nbsp; If you have secured debts, you have to decide whether to continue to pay on the debt (reaffirmation), pay the market value of the item (redemption) or return the secured item to the creditor.&nbsp; You generally cannot keep collateral unless you pay the debt.
	Discharge certain types of debt including child and spousal support, most student loans, court restitution orders and fines, and some taxes. &nbsp;
	Protect cosigners on your debts. &nbsp;If you discharge a debt in bankruptcy, your cosigner may still have to repay all or part of the loan.
	Discharge debts incurred after bankruptcy has been filed.


What is the difference between a Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy?

A Chapter 7 bankruptcy fully discharges most unsecured debt. &nbsp;It is designed to give you a fresh start.&nbsp; You must decide whether to pay for or give up secured property (see above).&nbsp; In a Chapter 13, both secured and unsecured debts are paid under a repayment plan. &nbsp;The plan must be completed within 3 to 5 years. &nbsp;Chapter 13 is often used when a debtor has regular income and a secured debt for a house or motor vehicle.&nbsp; The debtor wishes to keep the property but payments are in arrears. &nbsp;Chapter 13 allows the arrearage on the house or motor vehicle to be paid over time under the plan.

Both bankruptcies have an automatic stay provision.&nbsp; Neither a creditor nor a state court can take any further action on the debt without permission from the Bankruptcy Court. &nbsp;The stay will stop a foreclosure or repossession, at least until the creditor obtains ‘relief from stay.’

Will I lose my home or car if I file bankruptcy?&nbsp;

Under Ohio law, a person may keep certain personal or real property and income because it is ‘exempt’ from attachment, garnishment or sale by a bankruptcy trustee. &nbsp;An exemption may cover the value of an item only up to a certain dollar amount.&nbsp; The amount of these exemptions can change every year.&nbsp; The amounts of the exemptions are doubled when a married couple files together.&nbsp; For the exact amount of these exemptions, see CLAS’ fact sheet: Exempt Property under Ohio Law.&nbsp; You may not lose your home or motor vehicle during your bankruptcy if your equity in the property is fully exempt.&nbsp; If your home or vehicle is worth more than the exemption, there are still options.&nbsp; You can agree to keep making your payments until the debt is paid in full.&nbsp; Or you can pay the creditor the amount that the property is worth.&nbsp; That may be less than you owe.

Can I own anything after bankruptcy?&nbsp; 

You can keep exempt property and property obtained after the bankruptcy is filed. &nbsp;However, an inheritance, property settlement, or life insurance benefit received within 180 days after filing for bankruptcy may have to be paid to creditors.

Will filing bankruptcy affect my credit? &nbsp;

A bankruptcy can appear on your credit report for ten years. &nbsp;Since bankruptcy wipes out your old debts, you are likely to be in a better position to pay your current bills.

What else should I know?

Utility services - Public utilities, such as the gas company, cannot refuse or cut off service because you have filed for bankruptcy. &nbsp;The utility can require a deposit for future service. &nbsp;You will have to pay new bills after bankruptcy is filed.

Discrimination - An employer or government agency cannot discriminate against you because you have filed for bankruptcy.

Driver's license - If you lost your license solely because you couldn't pay court-ordered damages caused in an accident, bankruptcy will allow you to get your license back, unless the damages were for death or personal injury as a result of a DUI.

Co-signers - If someone has co-signed a loan with you and you file for bankruptcy, the co-signer may have to pay your debt. If you file a chapter 13, you may be able to protect co-signers, depending upon the terms of your chapter 13 plan.

What does it cost to file?&nbsp; 

Currently, it costs $335 to file a chapter 7 bankruptcy and $310 to file a chapter 13, whether for one person or a married couple.&nbsp; The court may allow payment of the filing fee in installments. &nbsp;Attorney's fees are an additional cost.

Can I keep my tax refund?&nbsp;

The bankruptcy trustee may want to use your refund to settle your debts.&nbsp; Talk with your attorney about whether your refund is exempt.

Can I make purchases before I file for bankruptcy?&nbsp;

You may purchase necessities.&nbsp; However, you should not incur debt when you know you will be filing for bankruptcy.&nbsp; Your creditors could claim that you are engaging in fraud.

How does the “Means Test” affect my bankruptcy?&nbsp;

The “means test” compares your last six months actual household income to the median household income in your area.&nbsp; Currently, the median household income is $43,978 for a household of one; $78,622 for a household of four and $8100 for each additional household member.&nbsp; If your income is above the median household income, you cannot file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.&nbsp; If your household income is below the median, you can file either a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.&nbsp;

What are the time limits on filing bankruptcy?&nbsp; 

&nbsp;You cannot file a chapter 7 bankruptcy if you received a chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in the past eight (8) years.&nbsp; Different rules apply for a chapter 13.&nbsp; If you have filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy, you must wait six (6) years before filing for a chapter 7.

11,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/13,Benefit Payments and Bankruptcy,Bankruptcy,,Consumer,"Certain benefit payments cannot be taken from you to pay a routine debt.&nbsp; These benefits are called ‘exempt.’&nbsp; You cannot be forced in a bankruptcy to use them to pay debts.&nbsp; These exempt funds include but are not limited to: social security; worker’s compensation; unemployment compensation, cash assistance payments under Ohio Works First (OWF); disability assistance (DFA) administered by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services; Supplemental Security Income (SSI); veterans benefits; black lung benefits and certain pensions.

If you receive one or more benefit payments listed above, your creditors may not be able to do anything bad to you that a bankruptcy will prevent.&nbsp; Certain benefit payments cannot be garnished by creditors.

Your benefit payments are also exempt if placed in a bank account.&nbsp; However if your account is attached by a creditor, you must request a hearing to prove the exemption.&nbsp; Until then, it can be inconvenient since the attachment freezes your account until the court releases it.&nbsp; This can result in bounced checks and cause embarrassment.&nbsp; To try to prevent an attachment of a bank account, you should write to any collection attorneys who have judgments against you to show that benefit payments is your only source of funds.&nbsp; There is one exception: do not deposit money in a bank that you owe money to directly or through an affiliated credit card.&nbsp; That bank will be able to set off your debt with your funds even if they are exempt.

Being in debt beyond your ability to pay is a great source of anxiety and can lead to unpleasant contacts with bill collectors and courts. However your creditors may be able to do less financial harm to you than you think.

12,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/14,What You Need to Know About Bankruptcy,Bankruptcy,,Consumer,"What Is Bankruptcy?

Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding in which a person who cannot pay his or her bills can get a fresh financial start.&nbsp; Filing for bankruptcy immediately stops all of your creditors from seeking to collect debts from you, at least until your debts are sorted out according to the law.

What Can Bankruptcy Do for You?

Bankruptcy may make it possible for you to:





	Eliminate your obligation to pay most or all of your debts.&nbsp; This is called a ``discharge'' of debts.&nbsp; It is designed to give you a fresh financial start.
	Stop foreclosure on your house or mobile home and allow you an opportunity to catch up on missed payments.&nbsp; Bankruptcy does not, however, automatically eliminate mortgages and other liens on your property without payment.
	Prevent repossession of a car or other property, or force the creditor to return property even after it has been repossessed.
	Stop wage garnishment, debt collection harassment, and similar creditor actions to collect a debt.
	Restore or prevent termination of utility service.
	Allow you to challenge the claims of creditors who have committed fraud or who are otherwise trying to collect more than you really owe.


What Bankruptcy Cannot Do?

Bankruptcy cannot cure every financial problem, nor is it the right procedure for every individual in financial distress. In bankruptcy, it is usually&nbsp;not&nbsp;possible to:


	Eliminate certain rights of “secured'' creditors.&nbsp; Common examples of these types of creditors are car loan and home mortgage providers.&nbsp; But bankruptcy can force secured creditors to take payments over time in the bankruptcy process and bankruptcy can eliminate your obligation to pay any additional money if your property is taken.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you generally cannot keep the collateral (ex. car or home) unless you continue to pay the debt.
	Discharge certain types of debts, such as child and spousal support, certain other debts related to divorce, most student loans, court restitution orders, criminal fines, and some taxes.
	Protect cosigners on your debts.&nbsp; When a relative or friend has co-signed a loan and the consumer discharges the loan in bankruptcy, the cosigner may still have to repay all or part of the loan.
	Bankruptcy does not allow you to discharge debts that arise after bankruptcy is filed.


What is Exempt Property?

Exempt property is property that the court allows you to keep after filing for bankruptcy.&nbsp; Exempt property will not be sold to pay-off creditors.&nbsp; Examples of exempt property include:





	$132,900 in home equity
	$3,675 in equity in a car,
	$450 in cash,
	$1,550 in jewelry,
	$2,325 in tools of your trade,
	$12,250 in household goods, and
	$1,225 of additional equity (wild card)


Can I Own Anything After Bankruptcy?

Yes!&nbsp; Many people believe they cannot own anything for a period of time after filing for bankruptcy; this is not true.&nbsp; You can keep your exempt property and anything you obtain after the bankruptcy is filed.&nbsp; However, if you receive an inheritance, a property settlement, or life insurance benefits within 180 days after filing for bankruptcy, that money or property may have to be paid to your creditors if the property or money is not exempt.
&nbsp;

Will Bankruptcy Affect My Credit?

There is no clear answer to this question.&nbsp; Unfortunately, bankruptcy will remain in your credit history for ten years.&nbsp; However, different creditors have different policies regarding&nbsp; bankruptcy.&nbsp; You may experience no difficulty in obtaining new credit.

13,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/15,Bank Account Attachment in Ohio,Non-wage Garnishment,,Consumer,"Once a judgment has been taken, a creditor may take any legal means to collect the debt. This can include wage garnishment, bank account or personal property attachment or taking a judgment lien against property.

Notice of a hearing on a bank attachment must be given to the debtor at least seven (7) business days before the hearing. The notice must include the debtor’s right to a hearing and a request for hearing form. A hearing is automatically scheduled but will be canceled if the debtor fails to request the hearing in writing within five (5) business days after receiving the notice.

The debtor and the bank receive notice of the intended attachment at the same time. A freeze is put on the funds in the account. The bank must decide if the creditor has the right to receive funds from the bank account and make a report to the court.

At the hearing the issues are limited to a defense or claim of exemption. The debtor has the burden to prove the claim of exemption or other defense. If the funds in the account are ‘exempt’ from attachment, the debtor must make that known to the court at the hearing. Examples of exempt funds are cash assistance under Ohio Works First, unemployment compensation, Disability Assistance (DFA), funds received under the Child Tax Credit or Earned Income Tax Credit, Social Security retirement and disability income and SSI, and Veterans benefits.

Exempt funds retain their exemption after being deposited in a bank account. However, the funds must be identifiable. If there are both exempt and non-exempt funds (such as wages) in an account, you will need to show which portion is exempt from attachment.

On the day of the hearing, bring proof of where the money in the account came from. You should have:

1.) an award letter showing the source of the funds

2.) deposit slips, receipts, or bank statements showing the exempt funds were deposited

3.) proof of the amount of exempt funds in the account at the time of attachment. If the balance in the attached account is more than the amount of your usual check, you will need to tell the court the source of the ‘extra’ money in the account. If you don’t have proof in writing, you will have to rely on your sworn testimony and hope that it will be enough for the court to release the money.

If you need the money immediately, you can try calling the attorney who represents the creditor to ask to have the funds released because they are exempt. If the attorney says the account will be released, ask for written confirmation. Call your bank a couple of days later to be sure the money has been released. Your bank will give written notice that your account has been credited for the amount that was frozen. If you are sure the money has been released, you do not need to go to court on the day of the hearing.

Either party has thirty (30) days from the date of a judgment within which to appeal the order.&nbsp; If no appeal is filed by either party, you are entitled to collect the judgment.&nbsp;

If the person who owes you money (debtor) has not voluntarily paid you, you could garnish wages or attach bank accounts.&nbsp; The garnishment and attachment forms are available at the court.&nbsp;

If you are unaware of where the debtor works or does banking, you could file a request for Debtor’s Exam with the court.&nbsp; During a Debtor’s Exam you ask questions about the debtor’s employment, banking and financial status.&nbsp; The Debtor’s Exam form is also available at the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Although there is a charge for filing a debtor’s exam request, garnishment and/or attachment, the Court may accept a previously filed poverty affidavit in lieu of payment (if you filed with a poverty affidavit).&nbsp; If the court does not accept your poverty affidavit, you are entitled to add the cost of the collection proceeding to the amount of your judgment.

Debt collectors are limited by law in how they can seek to collect debts. Your creditor has the right to:  Repossess any property that is “secured,” which means you have signed a contract giving him the right to repossess it.  Motor vehicles can usually be repossessed without a court order, but a court order is required if a repossession will breach the peace.  Repossessed property can be sold to pay your debt. If the entire debt is not paid, the creditor can sue you for the rest. Report your payment record to a Credit Reporting Agency.  You have the right to dispute incorrect or misleading information.  You can submit a written request to have incorrect information removed and your report updated. Sue you in court.  The creditor is required to attach an account to his complaint. If there is no account showing the history of the credit account you can seek to have the complaint dismissed.  You should seek further assistance.     After the court finds you owe money, the creditor can seek to:  Garnish your wages. However, you are entitled to keep what you would earn at 30 hours per week at the federal minimum wage. Many employers do not like garnishments. The law prohibits employers from firing an employee for being garnished by one creditor.  If more than one creditor is threatening to garnish you, you should consider filing a bankruptcy, seeking a Municipal or County Court Trusteeship or contacting a consumer debt counselor. Attach your bank account or other property or foreclose on real property. Summon you to court for judgment debtor examination to describe your income and property under oath.  &nbsp; Your creditor cannot harass you:   Put you in jail for not paying a debt. Garnish your wages without going to court. (A possible exception is a student loan). Garnish ‘exempt benefits’ such as Ohio Works First (OWF, welfare), social security, unemployment compensation and certain disability insurance benefits.  If they seek to attach a bank account that contains an ‘exempt’ benefit, you should request a hearing. Abuse or harass you by calling at unreasonable hours or an unreasonable number of times or using abusive language. Talk to other people, such as employers, relatives and neighbors about your debt. Make false statements about the debt, the creditor or their powers under the law.  For example, they cannot pretend to be part of the government or send you a letter designed to look like court papers. Contact you without telling you that you have the chance to dispute the bill. Threaten to do things they are not allowed to do.  &nbsp; This article is meant to give you general information and not specific legal advice.Prepared by Community Legal Aid Services, Inc.

Under Ohio law certain property is exempt and creditors cannot take it to pay debts that you owe. It is property that the court allows you to keep.&nbsp; Exempt property cannot be taken in a bank attachment, garnishment or other debt collection process or in a bankruptcy.

What Income is Uncollectible?&nbsp; 

In most instances the following sources of income are exempt from attachment or garnishment: Worker’s Compensation Benefits; Unemployment Compensation, Ohio Works First (OWF), Disability Assistance (DFA) administered by the Ohio Department of Human Services, Social Security retirement or disability benefits, Supplemental Security Income (S.S.I.), Veteran’s Benefits, Black Lung Benefits, Tax Refunds attributed to the Earned Income Credit or Child Tax Credit.

What Property is Uncollectible?


	$125,000 in equity in your home.
	$3,675 in equity in your car
	$575 per item in wearing apparel, household goods and furnishings, appliances ($12,250 aggregate)
	$1,550 in jewellery
	$2,325 in items you need for your job (tools, books, etc.)
	$450 in cash and bank accounts
	$1,225 in any other property


&nbsp;

Are my wages uncollectible?&nbsp;

Under Ohio law, wages are exempt in an amount equal to the greater of the following amounts:


	
	If paid weekly, thirty times the current federal minimum hourly wage; &nbsp;
	If paid biweekly, sixty times the current federal minimum hourly wage: if paid semimonthly, sixty-five times the current federal minimum hourly wage; if paid monthly, one hundred thirty times the current federal minimum hourly wage; or
	
	
	Seventy-five per cent of the disposable earnings owed.

17,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/19,In Debt and Bankruptcy is Not an Option?,Collection/Repossession,,Consumer,"WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON’T PAY A DEBT?

&nbsp;

A creditor will likely contact you to pay the debt. &nbsp;If you do not reach an agreement, the creditor may sue you to collect the debt. &nbsp;Once a judgment is obtained, the creditor may collect a debt by wage garnishment, back account attachment or by placing a lien on real property.

If the debt “secured,” the creditor may repossess the property without filing in court first. &nbsp;Secured debt is debt for which the lender has kept a right to reclaim the property. &nbsp;This is in the form of a lien or mortgage. &nbsp;If the debt is not paid the lender can repossess the property or force a foreclosure.

Your creditors cannot collect a debt from “exempt” property. &nbsp;Exempt property includes certain income and real and personal property.

&nbsp;

IF BANKRUPTCY IS NOT AN OPTION, WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

&nbsp;

Trusteeship is a plan you enter into with the Clerk of the municipal or county court where you live. &nbsp;In order to qualify, you must be being sued and have a source of income which can be garnished, such as wages. &nbsp;There is a small one-time charge for setting it up. &nbsp;Each payday you give the court 25% of your salary. &nbsp;The court pays this money to your creditors. &nbsp;As long as you make the payments, your wages cannot be garnished.

&nbsp;

Consumer Debt Counselors can help you set up a budget and a plan to pay your bills each month. &nbsp;As long as you make the payments, your creditors agree to not seek to collect from you by garnishment or other methods. &nbsp;

18,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/20,Judgement Debtor Examinations,Collection/Repossession,,Consumer,"A judgment debtor examination is one way a creditor can seek to collect a debt. The exam can only happen after a debtor has been sued and a court has determined that the debt is owed. At a judgment debtor examination you are put under oath and asked about your finances and your ability to pay the debt. You cannot be put in jail for failing to pay the debt. As long as you speak the truth, you walk away free after a few minutes of questioning.

If the time of the examination poses a hardship for you, the creditor’s attorney may agree to change the day or time of the exam. It the attorney does not, you could seek to file a motion for continuance with the Court.

If you fail to appear for a judgment debtor examination, you could be cited for contempt of court or an arrest warrant could be issued for you. There is no good reason to ignore a summons to appear at a judgment debtor examination.

If a warrant has been issued and you are stopped by the police for some other reason, you could find yourself being held in jail until an examination can be scheduled. This could mean missing work or school.

If you missed an exam, you should call the attorney to ask to reschedule as soon as possible. Most attorneys will be willing to do this, either at a future court appearance or at their office.

After the examination is over, it is important that the order for the arrest warrant be withdrawn. If you are in court, ask the judge or magistrate to issue an order to withdraw the warrant. If the attorney conducts the examination somewhere else, ask him to file it and send you a copy or give it to you to file personally. It is also a good idea to carry a copy of this order with you to show the police if needed.

If you can, it is a good idea to make payment arrangements on your debt with the creditor’s attorney. Creditors can garnish your wages, attach a bank account and take other action to collect the debt. Most will accept payment arrangements.

A creditor must follow the law when repossessing a vehicle.&nbsp; There are some legal defenses to repossession.&nbsp; If there is a grace period for payment, a creditor cannot declare default before the end of the grace period.&nbsp; If the creditor has repeatedly accepted late payments, the creditor should give notice that payments must be made on time.

After repossession.&nbsp; The creditor must sell or dispose of the vehicle in a commercially reasonable manner.&nbsp; By law, a creditor must give certain notices to the debtor.&nbsp; The creditor must send a notice of default and the right to cure to the debtor within five (5) business days.&nbsp; This notice must show the amount that the debtor must pay to re-obtain the vehicle.&nbsp; The debtor will be required to pay a variety of charges.&nbsp; This includes past due installments, late charges, reasonable expenses and a deposit.&nbsp;

At least ten (10) days before sale, the creditor must send another notice.&nbsp; This notice must state the time and place of the sale and the minimum price for the vehicle.&nbsp; The notice must also inform the debtor that he or she may still owe for the vehicle after the sale. &nbsp;This notice can be sent at the same time as the notice of default.&nbsp; There are some defenses to a sale if these requirements are not followed.

The vehicle must be sold for a reasonable price.&nbsp; If the vehicle is sold at public auction, the sales price will be presumed to be reasonable.&nbsp; Proceeds from the sale must be used to pay off the loan.&nbsp; If the proceeds do not fully pay off the loan, then the lender may file a court action to collect the rest of the loan.

There are few ways to avoid repossession.&nbsp; A debtor can seek to file bankruptcy.&nbsp; A debtor can request a consumer counseling agency to try to work out a payment plan.&nbsp;

If the creditor seeks to garnish wages, the debtor has a right to notice.&nbsp; A notice must be sent at least fifteen (15) days before a proposed garnishment.&nbsp; This allows the debtor time to try to avoid garnishment.&nbsp; There are several options:


	Pay the debt in full. Pay by check or money order and keep a copy for your records; or
	Ask your municipal or county court to appoint a trustee to receive your paycheck and make payments.&nbsp; The trustee will divide your non-exempt pay among all your creditors.&nbsp; You must continue until all the debts are paid.&nbsp; As long as you continue, no creditor can garnish your wages; or
	Pay the creditor an amount equal to what would be garnished. &nbsp;



You may also work with a debt counseling service to negotiate a debt payment schedule.&nbsp; This may take longer than 15 days.&nbsp; You may be garnished at least once. &nbsp;

A debtor has limited time to act.&nbsp; After the ’Fifteen Day Notice,’ the court will notify the debtor’s employer about the garnishment.&nbsp; The employer then gives notice to the debtor.&nbsp; To dispute the garnishment, the debtor must file a request for hearing with the court by the fifth (5) business day after receiving the employer’s notice of garnishment.&nbsp; The hearing must be held within twelve (12) days after the written request is received by the court.

At the hearing, the issues are limited.&nbsp; The court will hear a claim of exemption or a defense to the garnishment.&nbsp; The burden is on the debtor to prove that the wages of a given pay period are exempt or that the creditor has improperly calculated the amount due.&nbsp; Under Ohio law, a minimum amount of pay is exempt and cannot be garnished.&nbsp; This means that the creditor cannot take the entire paycheck.&nbsp; Use the garnishment calculator (available to download below) to figure out how much of your pay will be garnished. &nbsp;

A garnishment continues each paycheck until the debt is paid in full.&nbsp; One exception to continuous garnishment would be if a higher priority (tax levy or child or spousal support) garnishment order is received by the employer. &nbsp;

An employee may not be fired solely due to garnishment by one creditor in a 12 month period.&nbsp; An employee cannot be fired if an additional garnishment is for a support order.

	Child support
	Alimony
	Most student loans
	Court fines
	Criminal restitution


You can choose the kind of bankruptcy that best meets your needs, provided you meet certain criteria:

Chaper 7: 

A trustee is appointed to take over your porperty and make payments to creditors. You can only file for Chapter 7 relief every 8 years.

Chaper 13:

You can usually keep your property, but you must have a source of regular income. A payment plan will be set up and you must make regular payments to creditors.

22,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/24,What To Do When Creditors Are Harassing You,Other Credit Practices/Credit Reports,,Consumer,"What To Do When Creditors Are Harassing You

The Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (FDCPA) is a federal law to protect consumers from unfair and abusive behavior by debt collectors. &nbsp;A debt collector is someone trying to collect money owed to someone else. &nbsp;For example, if a credit card company turns your account over to a collections agency to try to get money from you, the FDCPA applies. However, if the credit card company is contacting you themselves to collect money that you owe them, the FDCPA does not apply.

&nbsp;

The FDCPA protects consumers: a debt collector may not harass you by mail, telephone or in any other way. &nbsp;Harassment includes (but is not limited to):


	
	Yelling or calling you names over the telephone
	
	
	Calling you numerous times each day or
	
	
	Calling at very early in the morning or very late at night
	


&nbsp;

If you do not want to talk to a bill collector anymore you can hang up. &nbsp;First say why you are doing this. For example: they are being loud and abusive, or you have no money to pay.

&nbsp;

If you are being harassed by creditors you should write to the creditor to demand that they stop bothering you. This is called a “Cease Communications Letter.” Send this letter by certified mail, return receipt requested. &nbsp;Save a photocopy of this letter and the return receipt as evidence. &nbsp;The bill collector can call to verify that you sent the letter but should not contact you anymore.

&nbsp;

A “Cease Communications Letter” will tell the debt collector to stop contacting you. If you wish, you may explain why you are unable to pay or the reason that you feel that you should not have to repay the debt. &nbsp;Once the creditor receives that letter they may only contact you one more time, to let you know that they have received it and to let you know what they plan to do with your account. &nbsp;If they contact you more than the one time allowed, they are in violation of the FDCPA. &nbsp;You may have a legal claim against them.

&nbsp;

A “Cease Communications Letter will not get rid of the debt. &nbsp;It just means that the debt collector will have to stop contacting you. &nbsp;They can still sue you in Court. &nbsp;If a creditor successfully sues you, they will get a judgment against you. &nbsp;The creditor could seek to garnish your wages or put a lien on your property.

&nbsp;

A sample “Cease Communications Letter” is below. &nbsp;You may send it to your creditors or use in drafting your own. The letter is intended only to be a sample of how such a letter should be drafted. &nbsp;Community Legal Aid Services cannot represent you in this matter. We make no guarantee that sending a letter based on our sample will resolve your problem.

23,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/25,Using Small Claims Court to Resolve a Consumer Claim,Small Claims Action,,Consumer,"What Is Small Claims Court? Small claims court is a division in each municipal and county court in Ohio. It provides a quick, informal and inexpensive way of resolving many types of disputes. In most small claims courts, the hearing is conducted by a magistrate instead of a judge. You may represent yourself or have a lawyer. However, corporations must be represented by a lawyer

What Types Of Disputes Can Small Claims Court Resolve? Small Claims Court can help resolve everyday disputes. Small claims court can help with most consumer disputes such as repair problems, breach of warranty, defective products, undelivered goods and insurance claims. Small claims court can also hear claims about damage to property caused by movers, cleaners and others. Small claims courts handle most civil actions where the claim is for money only.

You may want to check first to see if others have had similar problems. If so, an attorney who specializes in consumer law may be able to help you and the others in the same court case. This would not be a small claims case and would take much longer. However, the benefits may outweigh the wait.

The small claims court is specifically authorized to award damages to a consumer under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. In an appropriate case, a consumer may recover three times the amount of actual damage or $200, whichever is greater.

Are There Any Limitations To Small Claims Court? Small claims court is limited to resolving claims for the recovery of money of $3,000 or less. If your claim is for more than $3,000, you must decide if you are willing to seek less than the full amount of your claim.

Certain disputes cannot be heard by small claims court. Those include criminal, libel, slander, and actions seeking punitive damages.

Where Do I file a Complaint? Generally, you must file your complaint in the small claims court where the person or company you wish to sue resides or where the transaction took place. There may be problems if the individual or company against whom you are complaining is from out of town. In this situation, discuss the matter with the court staff. You will need to give an address where your complaint can be served on the opposing party.

How Do I Begin Proceedings? Call or visit the small claims court in your area. If necessary, make an appointment to discuss your problem. Experienced personnel at the court can provide you with a complaint form and help you prepare a written statement about your claim. However, they are not permitted to give you legal advice. A trial date will be set after the complaint is filed and served on the opposing party. At the trial, you (the plaintiff) will be asked to tell your side of the story and the party against whom you are complaining (the defendant) will be asked to tell their side. The law requires the person who brings the case to prove that they have a valid claim.

How Much Does It Cost? Ask a court clerk. You must pay a filing fee. If you are unable to afford the fee, you may be able to file a poverty affidavit to avoid prepayment of the fee. If you win the suit, the court may order the defendant to reimburse you for the fees.

What Can I Do To Prepare For Trial?


	Be organized. Think about what you will say before you get to court. Tell your story in the order in which the events occurred. Stick to the facts.
	Bring with you all the papers that support your case. This can include receipts, bills, canceled checks, warranties, contracts, letters and any other evidence about your dispute.
	You may have witnesses testify for you. At your request, the clerk will issue subpoenas to compel your witnesses to attend.
	If the defendant agrees to settle before the trial, do not sign a release or dismiss your suit until you have received payment.


What Can I Do If The Defendant Fails To Pay Me? If you win and the defendant fails to pay you, you have some options. You may seek to garnish the defendant's wages, an attach the defendant's personal property or bank account or place a judgment lien against any real estate owned by the defendant. Additional fees are required. Ask if court personnel can help you with the paperwork.

What Can I Do If I Lose? The magistrate may rule against you. You need to decide before you go to court whether you will want to challenge this decision. If so, you will need to do the following:


	If the magistrate rules while you are in court, before leaving the hearing, ask for a written report on the decision.
	Check with the Court Clerk to find out when the report has been completed and filed.
	Within 14 days of the filing of the report, you must file an ‘objection’ with the court detailing why you believe the magistrate was wrong.
	Mail a copy of your objections to the other party in the case.
	You must file a transcript of the proceedings (a word for word written record) with your objections. This transcript can be costly.
	A municipal or county court judge will review the case along with your objections and make a ruling.


If the judge upholds the decision, you can appeal the judge's decision to the court of appeals. At this point, the case becomes more complex. Consult with an attorney.

24,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/26,Your Right to Fair Debt Collection,Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,,Consumer,"&nbsp;

If you have personal, family or household debts, you are protected from abusive debt collectors even if you don’t or can’t file for bankruptcy. &nbsp;The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the Act) requires that debt collectors treat you fairly. &nbsp;It prohibits abusive methods of debt collection.

&nbsp;

A debt collector is any person whose principal business is the collection of debts of another. &nbsp;A creditor (the person or entity which gave you credit) and its employees seeking repayment of a debt are not considered ‘debt collectors.’

&nbsp;

The collector must send you a written notice within five days after you are first contacted to tell you the amount of money owed, the creditor’s name and what to do if you believe you do not owe the money. &nbsp;This ‘validation notice’ warns you that if a debt is not disputed it is considered valid.

&nbsp;

May a debt collector continue to contact me if I dispute the debt? &nbsp;A collector may not contact you if, within 30 days after you receive the written validation notice, you send the collection agency a letter stating you do not owe the money. &nbsp;However, a debt collector can renew collection activities by sending you proof of the debt, such as a copy of a bill for the amount owed.
&nbsp;

A collector may contact you in person, by mail, telephone, e-mail, telegram or fax. &nbsp;However, a debt collector may not contact you at inconvenient times or places, such as before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., unless you agree. &nbsp;A debt collector also may not contact you at work if the collector knows that your employer disapproves of such contacts.

&nbsp;

You can stop a debt collector from contacting you by writing a letter to the collector telling them to stop. Once the debt collector receives your letter, they may contact you once to say there will be no further contact or to notify you of intended action. &nbsp;The letter does not make the debt go away if you actually owe it. &nbsp;You could still be sued by the debt collector or your original creditor.


May a debt collector contact anyone else about my debt? &nbsp;If you have a lawyer, the debt collector must contact the lawyer, rather than you. A collector may contact other people, but only to find out where you live, what your phone number is and where you work. &nbsp;Debt collectors usually are prohibited from contacting relatives, neighbors or others more than once. &nbsp;In most cases, the debt collector may only tell you (or your attorney) that you owe money.


What types of debt collection practices are prohibited?
&nbsp;

Harassment- Debt collectors may not harass or abuse you or others they contact. &nbsp;For example, debt collectors may not:


	use threats of violence or harm;
	publish a list of consumers who refuse to pay their debts (except to a credit bureau);
	use obscene or profane language; or
	repeatedly use the telephone to annoy someone.


False statements- Debt collectors may not use any false or misleading statements when collecting a debt. For example, debt collectors may not:


	falsely imply that they are attorneys or government representatives;
	falsely imply that you have committed a crime;
	falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit bureau;
	misrepresent the amount of your debt;
	indicate that papers sent to you are legal forms when they are not; or
	indicate that papers being sent to you are not legal forms when they are.


Debt collectors also may not state that:


	you will be arrested if you do not pay your debt;
	they will seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property or wages, unless the collection agency or creditor intends to do so, and it is legal to do so; or
	actions, such as a lawsuit, will be taken against you, when such action legally may not be taken, or when they do not intend to take such action.


Debt collectors may not:


	give false credit information about you to anyone, even a credit bureau;
	send you anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency when it is not; or
	use a false name.


Unfair practices. &nbsp;Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, collectors may not:


	collect any amount greater than your debt, unless your state law permits such a charge;
	deposit a post-dated check prematurely;
	use deception to make you accept collect calls or pay for telegrams;
	take or threaten to take your property unless this can be done legally; or
	contact you by postcard.


What control do I have over payment of debts? &nbsp;If you owe more than one debt, any payment you make must be applied to the debt you indicate. A debt collector may not apply a payment to any debt you believe you do not owe.

If you believe a debt collector violated the law you have the right to sue in court within one year from the date the law was violated. If you win, you may recover money for the damages you suffered plus an additional amount up to $1,000. Court costs and attorney's fees also can be recovered.

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits certain acts by lenders offering credit.&nbsp; Lenders cannot deny you credit based on your sex, race, marital status, religion, national origin, age, or receipt of child support, social security or public assistance such as OWF, SSI or unemployment compensation.&nbsp; You have the right to have this reliable income considered like any other income.&nbsp; Creditors may ask for this information (except religion).&nbsp; But they may not use it against you when deciding whether to grant you credit.

Companies that regularly offer credit must follow the law.&nbsp; This includes banks, loan companies, stores, credit card companies and credit unions.&nbsp; Everyone who is part of the decision to grant credit must follow this law.&nbsp; Businesses applying for credit also are protected by this law.
Generally, a creditor may not request information about a spouse or require the signature of a spouse or any other co-signer except in limited circumstances.&nbsp;

If you are denied credit, you have a legal right to know why.&nbsp; The creditor must give you a written notice within thirty (30) days with the specific reasons.&nbsp; If you asked for credit orally, do not be discouraged from submitting a written application.Insist on a written statement of the reasons for any denial.
Take a witness with you if you think you will have problems in applying for credit.The creditor has no right to force your witness to co-sign for you.&nbsp; The witness should not co-sign.

A creditor must tell you if a denial of credit is based on information from a credit reporting agency.&nbsp; The creditor must give you the name and address of that agency.The credit reporting agency must let you know what information is in its files.

A credit agency may keep bankruptcy records for ten (10) years.&nbsp; Debts discharged in bankruptcy should be listed as “discharged” with a zero balance. Records of other debts may be kept for seven (7) years.
If you think the information in the credit agency’s files is wrong, ask the credit agency to investigate.&nbsp; You may submit a short written statement saying why you believe the information is wrong.&nbsp; The credit agency must note your dispute in future credit reports. The credit agency must send out a corrected report to anyone who checked your credit within the past six (6) months.

26,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/28,Getting a Loan: Using Your Home as Security,Loans,,Consumer,"If you need a personal loan and want to use home as security, be careful.&nbsp; If you default on the loan you could loose your home. &nbsp;For that reason, the law gives you some extra time to think about such a loan. &nbsp;When you use your home as collateral for a loan, you generally have the right to cancel within three business days. &nbsp;This is called your ""right of rescission.” &nbsp;It is guaranteed by the Federal Truth in Lending Act. &nbsp;The right of rescission gives you three extra days to reconsider whether you want to use your home to guarantee repayment for a personal loan. &nbsp;The right exists even if your home is a condominium, mobile home, or house boat, as long as it is your principal residence. The right applies to certain installment loans where you borrow a fixed amount and repay the debt on an agreed payment schedule.&nbsp; The right also applies to home equity credit lines, a form of revolving credit in which your home serves as collateral.

What Rescinding a Credit Transaction Means

Rescinding a credit transaction means you are canceling the deal. &nbsp;In other words, you decide that you do not want the loan or the service being financed. You can rescind the credit transaction within three days for any reason. &nbsp;For example, you may find better credit terms, such as a loan that offers a lower interest rate or does not require the use of your home as collateral.

How to Rescind a Credit Transaction

Unless you waive your right of rescission, you have until midnight of the third business day after the transaction to cancel the contract. &nbsp;Day One starts after all three of the following events occur:

1. You sign the credit contract. &nbsp;

2. You receive a Truth in Lending disclosure form which explains the key terms of the credit being offered: the annual percentage rate; the finance charge; the amount financed; the total of payments; and the payment schedule.

3. You receive two copies of a notice explaining your right to rescind.

For counting the three days, business days include Saturdays, but not Sundays or legal public holidays. &nbsp;For example, if the last of the above three events occurs on a Friday, you have until midnight on the following Tuesday to rescind. During this waiting period, your creditor should not take any action on your transaction.&nbsp; The creditor should not give you money from a loan or deliver any materials or start work.

If you decide to rescind, you must notify the creditor in writing that you are canceling the contract. You may use the form provided to you by the creditor; or send a letter or telegram.&nbsp; Whatever form of written notice you use, make sure it is sent before midnight of the third business day. &nbsp;Remember: You cannot rescind just by telephoning or visiting the creditor. &nbsp;

If you never received the disclosures or the notice of rescission from the creditor (see numbers 2 and 3 above), you can cancel at any time during the first three years after you sign the credit contract, or before you sell your home -- whichever occurs first.

What Happens When You Rescind

Within 20 days after a creditor receives your notice of rescission, all money or property you paid as part of the credit transaction must be returned to you. &nbsp;The creditor also must release any security interest in your home. &nbsp;

If you have received money or property (such as building materials) from the creditor, keep it until the creditor proves that your home is no longer being held as collateral and returns any money you already have paid.&nbsp; For example, the creditor may show you a release of a lien previously filed with your city or county clerk's office to prove your house is no longer collateral. &nbsp;You must then offer to return the creditor's money or property. &nbsp;If the creditor does not claim the money or property within 20 days, you may keep it.

Waiving Your Right to Rescind

Sometimes you may have a financial emergency and need immediate access to credit. For example, you may need to borrow money quickly to have a damaged roof repaired. The law allows you to waive your right of rescission if you have a ""bona fide personal financial emergency.""&nbsp; This enables you to have the loan process speeded up to meet the emergency situation. &nbsp;To use this right, you must give the creditor your own written statement (pre-printed forms are not allowed) describing the emergency and clearly stating that you are waiving your right to rescind. &nbsp;The statement must be dated and signed by you and anyone else who shares in the ownership of the home. &nbsp;Consider your decisions carefully: &nbsp;If you waive your right to rescind, you must go ahead with the credit transaction.

Typical Situations With No Right of Rescission

The right of rescission does not apply in all cases where your home is used as collateral for the loan. You do not have the right of rescission when: *


	you apply for a loan to purchase or build your principal home; *
	you consolidate or refinance with the same creditor a loan that is already secured by your home, and no additional funds are borrowed; or *
	a state agency is the creditor for the loan.


Even in these cases, however, you may have cancellation or ""cooling-off"" rights under state or local law.

27,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/29,Looking for the Best Mortgage,Loans,,Consumer,"A mortgage for a home purchase, refinancing, or home equity loan is a product, just like a car.&nbsp; The price and terms may be negotiable.&nbsp; You'll want to compare all the costs involved in obtaining a mortgage.&nbsp; Shopping, comparing, and negotiating may save you thousands of dollars.

Obtain Information from Several Lenders&nbsp;&nbsp;

Home loans are available from several types of lenders: thrift institutions, commercial banks, mortgage companies and credit unions.&nbsp; Different lenders may quote you different prices.&nbsp; Contact several lenders to make sure you're getting the best price. You can also get a home loan through a mortgage broker.&nbsp; Brokers arrange transactions rather than lending money directly; they find a lender for you.&nbsp; A broker's access to several lenders can mean a wider selection of loan products and terms from which you can choose.&nbsp; They are not required to find the best deal for you unless they have contracted with you to act as your agent.&nbsp; You should consider contacting more than one broker, just as you should with banks or thrift institutions.&nbsp;

Whether you are dealing with a lender or a broker may not always be clear.&nbsp; Some financial institutions operate as both lenders and brokers.&nbsp; Most brokers' advertisements do not use the word ""broker.""&nbsp; Be sure to ask whether a broker is involved.&nbsp; This information is important because brokers are usually paid a fee for their services that may be in addition to the lender's origination or other fees.&nbsp; A broker's compensation may be in the form of ""points"" paid at closing or as an add-on to your interest rate, or both.&nbsp; Ask each broker you work with how he or she will be paid so that you can compare the different fees.&nbsp; Be prepared to negotiate with the brokers as well as the lenders.

Obtain All Important Cost Information&nbsp;

Be sure to get information about mortgages from several lenders or brokers.&nbsp; Know how much of a down payment you can afford.&nbsp; Find out all the costs involved in the loan. Knowing just the amount of the monthly payment or the interest rate is not enough.&nbsp; Ask for information about the same loan amount, loan term, and type of loan so that you can compare the information.&nbsp; The following information is important to get from each lender and broker:


Rates 


	Ask each lender and broker for its current mortgage interest rates. Are they the lowest for that day or week?
	Ask whether the rate is fixed or adjustable.&nbsp; When interest rates for adjustable-rate loans go up, so does the monthly payment.
	If the rate quoted is for an adjustable-rate loan, ask how your rate and loan payment will vary, including whether your loan payment will be reduced when rates go down.
	Ask about the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).&nbsp; The APR takes into account not only the interest rate but also points, broker fees, and certain other credit charges that you may be required to pay, expressed as a yearly rate.


Points&nbsp; 

Points are fees paid to the lender or broker for the loan.&nbsp; They are often linked to the interest rate.&nbsp; Usually the more points you pay, the lower the rate.


	Check your local newspaper for information about rates and points currently offered.
	Ask for points to be quoted to you as a dollar amount—rather than just as the number of points—so that you will actually know how much you will have to pay.


Fees&nbsp; 

A home loan often involves many fees (loan origination or underwriting fees, broker fees, and transaction, settlement, and closing costs).&nbsp; Every lender or broker should be able to give you an estimate of its fees.&nbsp; Many of these fees are negotiable. Some fees are paid when you apply for a loan (such as application and appraisal fees) and others are paid at closing.&nbsp; In some cases, you can borrow the money needed to pay these fees but doing so will increase your loan amount and total costs. ""No cost"" loans may be available but they usually involve higher rates.


	Ask what each fee includes. Several items may be lumped into one fee.
	Ask for an explanation of any fee you do not understand.


Down Payments and Private Mortgage Insurance&nbsp; Some lenders require 20 percent of the home's purchase price as a down payment.&nbsp; If a 20 percent down payment is not made, lenders usually require the home buyer to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) to protect the lender in case the home buyer fails to pay.
When government-assisted programs such as FHA (Federal Housing Administration), VA (Veterans Administration), or Rural Development Services are available, the down
payment requirements may be substantially smaller.


	Ask about the lender's requirements for a down payment, including what you need to do to verify that funds for your down payment are available.
	Ask your lender about special programs it may offer.
	If PMI is required for your loan,
	Ask what the total cost of the insurance will be.
	Ask how much your monthly payment will be when including the PMI premium.
	Ask how long you will be required to carry PMI.


Obtain the Best Deal That You Can&nbsp;

Once you know what each lender has to offer, negotiate for the best deal that you can. On any given day, lenders and brokers may offer different prices for the same loan terms to different consumers, even if those consumers have the same loan qualifications.&nbsp; Have the lender or broker write down all the costs associated with the loan.&nbsp; Then ask if the lender or broker will waive or reduce one or more of its fees or agree to a lower rate or fewer points.&nbsp; You'll want to make sure that the lender or broker is not agreeing to lower one fee while raising another or to lower the rate while raising points.&nbsp; There's no harm in asking lenders or brokers if they can give better terms than the original ones they quoted or than those you have found elsewhere.&nbsp;

Once you are satisfied with the terms you have negotiated, you may want to obtain a written lock-in from the lender or broker.&nbsp; A lock-in should include the agreed interest rate, the period the lock-in lasts, and the number of points to be paid.&nbsp; A fee may be charged for locking in the loan rate.&nbsp; This fee may be refundable at closing.&nbsp; Lock-ins can protect you from rate increases while your loan is being processed.&nbsp; If rates fall, however, you could end up with a less favorable rate.&nbsp; If that happens, try to negotiate a compromise with the lender or broker.

Remember: Shop, Compare, Negotiate&nbsp;

Shop around to compare costs and terms.&nbsp; Negotiate for the best deal.&nbsp; You can usually find information in your local newspaper and the Internet on interest rates and on points for several lenders.&nbsp; Since rates and points can change daily, check often when shopping for a home loan.&nbsp; But the newspaper does not list the fees, so be sure to ask the lenders about them.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to make lenders and brokers compete with each other for your business.

28,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/30,OSBA Law Facts Ohio’s Credit Laws,Other Credit Practices/Credit Reports,,Consumer,"Signing a credit purchase slip or other sales contract can have major legal consequences, creating rights and liabilities for you and others. Treat your signature carefully and with the importance it deserves. If you are ever in doubt about signing a document, see an attorney before signing.

What documents are needed for installment purchases? 

Most of us have bought merchandise on a time payment or installment plan. When you buy an item such as a television set or car on the installment plan, you must sign certain papers before you can take the item. These papers may be one or a combination of legal documents: a retail installment sales contract, a security agreement, a conditional sales contract and/or a promissory note. A combination of these instruments may be found in the same document.

What does a retail sales contract involve? 

In Ohio, all retail installment sales contracts or agreements for the purchase of consumer goods must be in writing. The seller must give the buyer a copy of this document either when it is signed or when the goods are delivered. There is usually a statement in the contract whereby the buyer acknowledges receipt of a copy of the signed contract. The receipt in the body of the contract that the buyer has signed is proof that the buyer has received a copy of the contract.

Certain details must appear in the written contract, including the price, down payment, cost of insurance (if any), finance charges, balance due under the contract and details of payments.

By law, a retail seller is allowed to collect certain finance charges. Many retail installment sales contracts provide for an additional charge or penalty against the buyer who is late in making a payment. There are restrictions about when this charge may be made and its amount. If charges are greater than the law allows, the excess charges may be unenforceable against the buyer. If you believe you are being overcharged, it would be wise to contact an attorney.

What is a security agreement? 

You may have heard the term chattel mortgage, conditional sale or security agreement. No matter what they are called, these documents are designed to create for the seller or lender a security interest in the goods that you are purchasing or are putting up as collateral for your loan.

This security interest is designed to ensure that you will pay your debt. The seller or lender, by obtaining a security interest, will have important rights, including the right to repossess (take back) the goods, sometimes without advance notice or warning, if you should fall behind in your payments.

What is a promissory note? 

A promissory note is a written promise to pay a sum of money to another person or a company. This note and security interest, if any, may then be sold to a finance company, a bank or an individual. The buyer of the note and the accompanying security agreement will generally acquire the same security interest in what you purchased as the original seller had before the note was sold. If there is a later legal action against you for non-payment of the note, you may be able to claim legal defenses based on the seller’s breach of warranty, fraud or breach of contract. In a consumer transaction, these legal defenses are as good against the buyer of the note as against the original seller.

A promissory note usually provides that, when you fail to pay an installment within a certain period after it is due, the entire balance may become immediately due and payable. This is called an acceleration provision.

What if I can’t make the payments? 

If you default in making your payments, the seller or lender has the legal right to repossess the goods that serve as collateral for the debt. Having taken the goods back, the seller or lender may, after notifying you, re-sell the goods, and you may find yourself liable for the difference between the price for which they are sold and the amount you still owe. This is called a deficiency. The law gives you certain rights to redeem the collateral before the seller or lender sells the goods.

On the other hand, the seller or lender, after notifying you, may keep the goods as a full satisfaction of your obligation.&nbsp; If the goods are consumer goods (used primarily for personal, family or household purposes), and you have paid more than 75 percent of the purchase price, the seller or lender cannot repossess the goods, but can only sue you for money damages for breach of contract.&nbsp;
In any case, when goods you have purchased are repossessed, it would be wise to see your attorney, who can tell you what rights you have with respect to the goods or payments you have made.

If you fail to pay an installment, the seller or owner of the promissory note may get a court judgment against you for the balance owed rather than to repossess the article you purchased.

What about car insurance? 

When automobiles are financed or sold on an installment plan, the seller or financing agency often requires you to insure against damage to the automobile so that the seller’s or agency’s secured interest in the vehicle is protected. Such insurance can be provided by an ordinary, full-coverage auto insurance policy.

If you fail to obtain or provide proof of insurance, the seller or financing agency may obtain property damage insurance on the vehicle to protect their interests. This is often called forced placed insurance, the cost of which is added to the amount you owe on the automobile. Forced placed insurance is generally very expensive.
Remember that Ohio law requires you to keep and provide proof of financial responsibility to satisfy your liability for personal injuries and property damage you cause to others. If you do not carry the required proof of financial responsibility, your driving privileges may be suspended.

The seller or financing agency may offer you credit life insurance and disability life insurance that would cover the payments on the vehicle in the event of your death, disability or unemployment. However, you should investigate such plans thoroughly to consider the cost and scope of the coverage.&nbsp;

Some people consider the purchase of “gap” insurance.&nbsp; If your vehicle is totaled, your insurance (or that of the person causing the accident) may pay you the value of the vehicle, which could be less than the amount owed to the lender.&nbsp; “Gap” insurance is designed to cover this shortfall between the value of the vehicle and any amount owed.

&nbsp;

What should I know about credit cards? 

Before you “charge it,” you should understand the obligations you are assuming and carefully read all applications for charge accounts and credit cards, as well as all charge slips and notices, before signing or accepting them.

Many businesses or credit card companies will allow you to defer the payment of amounts owed for 30 days without interest, while others add interest immediately. If stated in the credit agreement, Ohio law allows for a creditor to charge you as much as 25 percent annual interest on the unpaid balance.

How can I check my credit rating? 

The amount of “credit power,” or your credit score, is based on many factors. These include income, payment history, secured and unsecured debt and the amount of credit available to you.&nbsp;Generally, you may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate for various types of loans if your credit score is higher. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) states that U.S. consumers are entitled to a free copy of their credit report each year.&nbsp; The nation’s credit reporting agencies have jointly developed the following website that you can use to get your free credit report:&nbsp; www.annualcreditreport.com, or you can request your free credit report by calling 877-322-8228.

The FCRA, which is enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, gives the consumer some rights against the use of wrong information in the files of credit bureaus. In part, the FCRA provides:


	You have the right to know the “nature and substance of all information.”
	You have the right to be told the source of almost all information if credit is denied.
	You have the right to be told the names of any firms that received your credit record during the previous six months (or two years if the report was furnished for employment purposes).
	You have the right to obtain the information free of charge from the credit agency if you have been denied credit, insurance or employment within 30 days of your inquiry. Otherwise, the reporting agency is permitted to charge a reasonable fee for making the disclosure.
	The credit bureau must investigate any information that you feel is incorrect. If the information proves incorrect, the agency must remove it from its files and, on your request, inform those who have received the information that it has been removed.
	After investigation, you can write a brief statement of your side of the story to put in the file. At your request, the agency must send your version of the dispute free of charge to anyone who has denied you credit within the past 30 days. If you ask, the agency also must send a copy of your version of the dispute to selected other businesses for a reasonable fee.
	You have the right to have a consumer report withheld from anyone who, under the law, does not have a legitimate business need for this information.



While the FCRA gives you certain rights, it also imposes some restrictions. It does not give you the right, when you visit the credit bureau, to receive a copy of or to physically handle your file, and it does not apply when you apply for commercial credit or business insurance.

What about bank charges?

Banks earn significant income from fees and charges. You may be charged an additional fee to use an ATM machine, particularly if it is not affiliated with your bank. Banks, as well as non-bank lenders, may also charge you an additional fee if you write a check or submit an online payment that is dishonored for insufficient funds, so use caution in keeping your checkbook balanced. Also, lenders may charge you a late payment fee if you do not pay the amount owed on time.

What other liability could I have? 

It is possible to be subject to legal liability arising out of a transaction even though you have not signed anything or know of it. For example, one partner in a partnership may be held liable for acts or agreements of other partners, or a husband or wife may be responsible for a spouse’s charge accounts or installment purchases in certain situations, such as when both spouses’ names are on the account. Also, in some situations, parents may be liable for their children’s actions if property was damaged willfully or there is damage as a result of the use of a motor vehicle.

You also may be liable for a credit obligation if you have co-signed a credit agreement or guaranteed the payment of the debt of a friend or relative. Be sure you understand all the circumstances before you sign because your liability for the debt is the same as that of the maker (e.g., friend or relative) even though you have received no benefit.

You should also know that, when a lease is signed by more than one person, such as for a college apartment, each party is responsible for the full rent, not just his or her share (unless otherwise stipulated in the lease).

Student loans, whether signed by a parent or a student, cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, unless you can show that paying the loans will create “undue hardship,” which is very difficult to prove. A test commonly used by courts allows for a student loan to be discharged only when:&nbsp; 1) the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a “minimal” standard of living if forced to repay the loans; 2) additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the student loan repayment period; and 3) the debtor has made good-faith efforts to repay the loans. Student loans may also require the borrower to pay attorney fees and collection costs.

Check before you sign: 


	Read every paper you are asked to sign, including the fine print.
	Don’t sign any paper that has blank spaces on it. Every space should be filled in.
	Compare the total charges—cost of item plus credit charges, etc.—with the cash price.
	Don’t rely on sales talk. Oral promises usually are not enforceable unless included in the contract.
	Don’t sign if you can't understand the words. Ask questions!
	Take your time. Don’t be in a hurry.



If in doubt, consult your attorney, who can do more good before you sign than after.

BE CAREFUL!


Is the person or the company with whom you are dealing trying to trick you, trying to mislead you or trying to make you think they are your friend?&nbsp; Do not allow that person to make you the victim of a scam that can lead to the foreclosure of your home.


	Read and understand any papers you are asked to sign.
	Do not let anyone pressure you to sign any papers.
	Ask for a complete set of papers to take home and go over before you sign.&nbsp; Make sure the copies you are given are already filled in with the&nbsp;&nbsp; information about you and your loan.
	Get help from someone who understands loans.&nbsp; Local banks,&nbsp; savings and loan associations or credit unions will often have reliable information about loans.
	Check with others about any company or person with whom you are dealing.&nbsp; Ask your friends and family to help you.
	Does the Loan Application correctly list your income and other information about you?&nbsp; Make sure it is correct. Do not sign if it is not.
	Are all promises made to you in&nbsp; writing?&nbsp; If they aren’t written down, it is easy for them to be forgotten.
	Make sure you understand any costs and fees that you will have to pay.&nbsp; The Settlement Statement lists each one.&nbsp; Read it carefully.&nbsp; Ask questions.&nbsp; Are you being charged too much?&nbsp; Are you being charged for things you don’t need?&nbsp; Are you being charged for things you didn’t get?
	Compare the costs and fees to what other lenders (e.g., banks, savings and loans, credit unions, etc.) would charge you for the same loan.
	Make sure you understand (and agree with) the amount of the interest rate and the amount of the monthly payments you are being asked to pay.
	If your interest rate is an adjustable interest rate, do you know how much your monthly payments will increase when the interest rate goes up?&nbsp; If they go up and you can’t pay, then you can lose your home in foreclosure.
	When it comes time to sign the final loan papers at the closing, have someone there with you that you can trust to help you understand the papers that you will be asked to sign. You will be asked to sign many papers.&nbsp; Take your time.&nbsp; Make sure you know and understand what you are signing.&nbsp; Do not let anyone pressure you to sign papers until you are ready to sign them.
	Get copies of any loan papers that you sign, and keep these copies for your records.
	Don’t panic if you sign the loan papers and you want to get out of the loan.&nbsp; There should be a Notice of Cancellation in the loan papers the lender gave you when you signed the final loan papers at the closing.&nbsp; Read carefully the instructions in the Notice of Cancellation.&nbsp; For most people, the envelope containing the Notice of Cancellation must be postmarked no later than midnight of the 3rd business day following the day the loan papers are signed.&nbsp; Make sure you have proof that shows the day you sent the notice of cancellation to the lender — for example, before you drop it in the mail, go to the post office, and ask about getting a proof of mailing.


REMEMBER

If you don’t like it, or

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can’t understand it,

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you shouldn’t sign it!

32,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/34,Consumer's Guide to Credit Reporting,Credit Practices/Credit Reports,,Consumer,"If you've ever applied for credit, a loan, insurance or a job, a consumer reporting agency (or credit bureau) is probably keeping a file on you.&nbsp; This file will have information on how you pay your bills, whether you've been sued, arrested or filed for bankruptcy.&nbsp; Consumer reporting agencies sell information about you to creditors, employers, landlords, insurers and other businesses.&nbsp; This information is in a consumer report which describes where you work and live, your debts and bill-paying habits.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act gives you specific rights in dealing with consumer reporting agencies.&nbsp; It requires consumer reporting agencies to give correct and complete information to businesses that review your application for credit, insurance or a job.

How do I know if I was I denied credit because of a ""bad credit report""?&nbsp; 

By law, a company that denied you credit must tell you the specific reasons.&nbsp; You can provide more information to correct mistakes in your credit report.&nbsp; Creditors must consider the information you give.

How do I find the consumer reporting agency that has my file?&nbsp; The company that denied your application must give you the name, address, and telephone number of the credit reporting agency that gave negative information.

Do I have the right to know what the report says?&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes.&nbsp; The consumer reporting agency is required to give you all the information in your report.&nbsp; You have the right to be told the name, address and phone number of anyone who received a report on you in the past year.&nbsp; If you’re asking about a job application, you can get the names of employers who received a report during the past two years.&nbsp; The consumer reporting agency will give you a summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Is this information free?&nbsp;

Yes.&nbsp; You are entitled to one free credit report once every year from each of the three major consumer reporting agencies:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TransUnion P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19022; (800) 916-8800
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equifax P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241; (800) 685-1111
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experian P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; (888) 397-3742
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To get your free credit report, visit annualcreditreport.com, or call 1-877-322-8228.&nbsp; Or you can send a completed Annual Credit Request Form to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.&nbsp;

Do not contact each of the three credit reporting agencies or any other agency to receive your free credit report. These agencies will try to sell you something, or advertise free services which will actually have fees attached.&nbsp;

If you have never requested your credit report before, you should order your report from all three of the credit reporting agencies at once. In subsequent years, you may want to order one report every four months so you are able to frequently monitor the information in your credit report.

You can also get a free credit report if your application for credit was denied because of information given by a consumer reporting agency.&nbsp; If you request a copy of your report within 60 days of receiving a denial notice you are entitled to the information without charge.

What can I do if the information wrong or incomplete?&nbsp; 

Send a written notice to the consumer reporting agency that produced the report.&nbsp; The agency is required to delete or investigate the items in question.&nbsp; If the new investigation reveals an error, a corrected credit report will be sent to you.&nbsp; If you request, it can be sent, for free, to anyone who received your report in the past six months.&nbsp; Job applicants may have corrected reports sent to employers who received a copy during the past two years.&nbsp; If the consumer reporting agency deletes the inaccurate information, the agency cannot put it back into your file without written notice to you.

If you dispute information in your file, the consumer reporting agency may forward your dispute to the creditor or person who furnished the information.&nbsp; You should also contact the source of that information directly.&nbsp; Many creditors have a special address for this purpose.&nbsp; Creditors have a duty to avoid reporting inaccurate information.&nbsp; If you tell the creditor that you dispute information, the company must note that the information is disputed when it is given to a consumer reporting agency.

What can I do if the consumer reporting agency won't correct the report?&nbsp; 

When you dispute information in your file the credit reporting agency must investigate.&nbsp; The investigation may not resolve your dispute.&nbsp; Tell the consumer reporting agency to include your version of the disputed information in your file and in future reports.&nbsp; You may submit a written statement of 100 words or less about the information in your report that you believe is missing or inaccurate. This statement will be included in your credit report and visible to you and anyone who requests your credit report.

How long can consumer reporting agencies report unfavorable information?&nbsp; 

Generally seven years.&nbsp; However, there are exceptions:


	Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years;
	Criminal convictions and defaults on student loans have no time limitations;
	Information reported due to an application for a job with a salary over $75,000 has no time limit;
	Information reported due to an application for over $150,000 worth of credit or life insurance has no time limit;
	Information concerning a lawsuit or judgment against you can be reported for seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out, whichever is longer.


Can anyone get a copy of the report?&nbsp;

No.&nbsp; It's given only for specific permitted reasons.

Do I have to be told before someone asks for a report about me?&nbsp; 

No.&nbsp; However, a consumer reporting agency may not provide a credit report to an employer unless the employer has your written permission.&nbsp; Also, your written permission is needed before medical information may be reported by a consumer reporting agency for credit, insurance, or employment purposes.

What if a credit reporting agency has violated my rights?&nbsp;&nbsp;

You may want to seek legal advice.&nbsp; In some cases, a consumer reporting agency or other person who has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act must pay damages and attorney fees.

The Federal Trade Commission can't act as your lawyer in private disputes.&nbsp; Information about your experience and concerns is vital to the enforcement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.&nbsp; Send questions or complaints to the FTC, Washington, DC&nbsp; 20580.&nbsp; Or file a complaint at ftc.gov

Determining what type of loans you have: Your options for student loans depend on the type of loans you have. If you don’t know, call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4- FED-AID.&nbsp; The center’s counselors can help you figure out what types of loans you have. It is often hard to tell the difference between private and federal loans.&nbsp; The lender may be the same.

Private Loans:&nbsp; You may be put into default as soon as one payment is missed.&nbsp; If you are in default, contact the lender. Ask the lender to modify the loan or repayment agreement.&nbsp; Modification could include an interest rate reduction. Be aware that private lenders are not required to offer flexible repayment, cancelation or deferment options.

Federal Loans:&nbsp; You are in default for most federal loans if you have not made payments for nine (9) months.&nbsp; The entire loan balance is due once you default.
&nbsp;
If you are in default, you may be able to rehabilitate the loan with an affordable payment. The Higher Education Act provides that lenders set reasonable and affordable payments. If a collection agency is demanding a payment amount that is unaffordable, you have options:


	Ask to speak with a supervisor or agency ombudsman, if they have one; or
	File a complaint with the loan holder stating that the collector is unwilling to set a reasonable and affordable payment; or
	If your problem is with the Department of Education, call their ombudsman at 877-557-2575 for help in obtaining a reasonable and affordable payment.


If you are not in default, you can ask the loan holder to place your loan in deferment or forbearance.&nbsp; If you can afford to pay something each month but not the full payment, apply for a more affordable repayment plan. &nbsp;

To qualify for the income-based repayment plan (IRB), you must show that you have too much debt and too little income.&nbsp; IRB uses a sliding scale to determine your payment.&nbsp; If you earn below 150% of the poverty level for your family size, your payment will be $0.&nbsp; If you earn more, your loan payment will be capped at 15% of whatever you earn above 150% of the poverty level.&nbsp; This amount will usually be less that 10% of your total income.&nbsp; You will have to verify your income every year.&nbsp; Your payment may be adjusted based on changes in income or family size. &nbsp;

Discharging a student loan:&nbsp; In general, student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.&nbsp; There are a few exceptions.

Federal law allows certain borrowers to discharge their student loans in very limited circumstances.&nbsp; You must fit within one of the categories listed below:


	You did not have a high school diploma or GED at the time of enrollment. The student loan must be from 1986 or later; or
	The school closed while you were enrolled or within 90 days of when you withdrew from the school. The student loan must be from 1986 or later; or
	You did not complete the program, and the school did not properly return part of the loan to the lender. The student loan must be from 1986 or later; or
	You had a status or condition at the time of enrollment that was a legal barrier to employment in the field. The student loan must be from 1986 or later.&nbsp; Examples include:
	
		You were in a security guard program or nursing, early childhood or similar program training to work with children or disabled persons but had a felony criminal record.
		You were in a nursing or custodial maintenance program, but you had a physical or mental disability that prevented you from working in those fields.
		You did not have a high school diploma AND a high school diploma is necessary to take a license or certification exam that is required for the job.
	
	



	The borrower is now deceased or totally and permanently disabled; or
	The borrower’s signature on the loan application was forged.



If you fit into one of these categories, you can begin the process of discharging your loan at the U.S. Department of Education website, www.myeddebt.com.

In circumstances of extreme financial hardship, a student loan may be discharged through bankruptcy.&nbsp; You must be able to prove that payment of the loan “will impose an undue hardship on your and your dependents.”&nbsp; Courts use different standards to evaluate whether a borrower has shown undue hardship. It is very difficult to prove.&nbsp; This is true for both private and federal loans.&nbsp; Contact a bankruptcy attorney to discuss your options.

Wage Garnishment:&nbsp; If you fail to pay or make arrangements, the federal government can garnish your wages for federal loans.&nbsp; The government does not need to seek a judgment in court first. Fifteen percent (15%) of your after-tax wages can be garnished. However, your pay cannot be reduced below $217.50 per week.&nbsp; You must be notified of the garnishment and have an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the amount of the debt and terms of repayment.
For private loans, the lender must sue in court to obtain a judgment.&nbsp; The lender must follow state garnishment laws.&nbsp; In Ohio, up to 25% of your after tax wages can be garnished for a student loan. However, your pay cannot be reduced below $217.50 per week.&nbsp; You must be notified of the garnishment and have an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the amount of the debt and terms of repayment.&nbsp; To avoid garnishment, contact the private lender or collection agency to work out a payment arrangement.

Tax refund:&nbsp; The Department of Education may seek to take your federal tax refund if you are in default.&nbsp; You can avoid this by pursuing one of the options above.

86,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/92,Brief Description of Chapters 7 and 13 Bankruptcy,Bankruptcy,,Consumer,"A Chapter 7 bankruptcy fully discharges most unsecured debt.&nbsp; It is designed to give you a fresh start.&nbsp; ‘Secured debt’ is debt on which a lender has kept a right to claim the property if the debt is not paid.&nbsp; For example, the lender for a home loan will keep a mortgage on the house.&nbsp; If the debt is not paid, the lender can foreclose on the mortgage and force a sale of the house to pay the loan.&nbsp; The same applies to motor vehicles and other property on which a lender has taken a lien.&nbsp; If you have secured debts, you have to decide whether to continue to pay on the debt (which is called reaffirmation), pay the market value of the item (which is usually referred to as redemption) or have the secured item returned to the creditor.

A Chapter 7 bankruptcy cannot discharge all debt.&nbsp; For instance, spousal support and child support cannot be discharged.&nbsp; However, a division of property in a termination of marriage can be discharged.&nbsp; In general, student loans cannot be discharged.&nbsp; There are very limited exceptions.

In a Chapter 13, secured and unsecured debts are paid under a repayment plan.&nbsp; The plan must be completed within 3 to 5 years. Chapter 13 is often used when the debtor has regular income and a secured debt for a house or motor vehicle.&nbsp; The debtor wishes to keep the property but payments are in arrears. Chapter 13 allows the arrearage on the house or motor vehicle to be paid over time under the plan.

Both bankruptcies have an automatic stay provision.&nbsp; That means a creditor or state court cannot take any further action on the debt without permission of the Bankruptcy Court.&nbsp; The stay will stop a foreclosure action or vehicle repossession, at least until the creditor obtains ‘relief from stay.’

Under either type of bankruptcy, a debtor may keep certain property through the use of exemptions. Under Ohio law a person may keep certain personal or real property and income because they are ‘exempt’ from attachment, garnishment or sale by a bankruptcy trustee.&nbsp; Some exemptions are ‘blanket exemptions.’&nbsp; The exemption applies to the entire value.&nbsp; For instance, many benefit payments are totally exempt, such as SSI.&nbsp; Other exemptions cover the value of an item only up to a certain dollar amount.&nbsp; The amount of these exemptions can change every year.&nbsp; For the exact amount of these exemptions, see CLAS’ fact sheet: Exempt Property under Ohio Law.&nbsp;

A bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for 10 years. Many people wonder if filing a bankruptcy will have a negative effect on getting financial aid for schools or a bank loan in the future.&nbsp; A bank will probably review how you have handled your finances since you filed bankruptcy. So when your bankruptcy is finally discharged, be wary of taking on more debt than you can handle.

Signing a credit purchase slip or other sales contract can have major legal consequences, creating rights and liabilities for you and others. Treat your signature carefully and with the importance it deserves. If you are ever in doubt about signing a document, see an attorney before signing.

What documents are needed for installment purchases?

Most of us have bought merchandise on a time payment or installment plan. When you buy an item such as a television set or car on the installment plan, you must sign certain papers before you can take the item. These papers may be one or a combination of legal documents: a retail installment sales contract, a security agreement, a conditional sales contract and/or a promissory note. A combination of these instruments may be found in the same document.

What does a retail sales contract involve?

In Ohio, all retail installment sales contracts or agreements for the purchase of consumer goods must be in writing. The seller must give the buyer a copy of this document either when it is signed or when the goods are delivered. There is usually a statement in the contract whereby the buyer acknowledges receipt of a copy of the signed contract. The receipt in the body of the contract that the buyer has signed is proof that the buyer has received a copy of the contract.

Certain details must appear in the written contract, including the price, down payment, cost of insurance (if any), finance charges, balance due under the contract and details of payments.

By law, a retail seller is allowed to collect certain finance charges. Many retail installment sales contracts provide for an additional charge or penalty against the buyer who is late in making a payment. There are restrictions about when this charge may be made and its amount. If charges are greater than the law allows, the excess charges may be unenforceable against the buyer. If you believe you are being overcharged, it would be wise to contact an attorney.

What is a security agreement?

You may have heard the term chattel mortgage, conditional sale or security agreement. No matter what they are called, these documents are designed to create for the seller or lender a security interest in the goods that you are purchasing or are putting up as collateral for your loan.

This security interest is designed to ensure that you will pay your debt. The seller or lender, by obtaining a security interest, will have important rights, including the right to repossess (take back) the goods, sometimes without advance notice or warning, if you should fall behind in your payments.

What is a promissory note?

A promissory note is a written promise to pay a sum of money to another person or a company. This note and security interest, if any, may then be sold to a finance company, a bank or an individual. The buyer of the note and the accompanying security agreement will generally acquire the same security interest in what you purchased as the original seller had before the note was sold. If there is a later legal action against you for non-payment of the note, you may be able to claim legal defenses based on the seller’s breach of warranty, fraud or breach of contract. In a consumer transaction, these legal defenses are as good against the buyer of the note as against the original seller.

A promissory note usually provides that, when you fail to pay an installment within a certain period after it is due, the entire balance may become immediately due and payable. This is called an acceleration provision.

What if I can’t make the payments?

If you default in making your payments, the seller or lender has the legal right to repossess the goods that serve as collateral for the debt. Having taken the goods back, the seller or lender may, after notifying you, re-sell the goods, and you may find yourself liable for the difference between the price for which they are sold and the amount you still owe. This is called a deficiency. The law gives you certain rights to redeem the collateral before the seller or lender sells the goods.

On the other hand, the seller or lender, after notifying you, may keep the goods as a full satisfaction of your obligation.&nbsp; If the goods are consumer goods (used primarily for personal, family or household purposes), and you have paid more than 75 percent of the purchase price, the seller or lender cannot repossess the goods, but can only sue you for money damages for breach of contract.

In any case, when goods you have purchased are repossessed, it would be wise to see your attorney, who can tell you what rights you have with respect to the goods or payments you have made.

If you fail to pay an installment, the seller or owner of the promissory note may get a court judgment against you for the balance owed rather than to repossess the article you purchased.

What about car insurance?

When automobiles are financed or sold on an installment plan, the seller or financing agency often requires you to insure against damage to the automobile so that the seller’s or agency’s secured interest in the vehicle is protected. Such insurance can be provided by an ordinary, full-coverage auto insurance policy.

If you fail to obtain or provide proof of insurance, the seller or financing agency may obtain property damage insurance on the vehicle to protect their interests. This is often called forced placed insurance, the cost of which is added to the amount you owe on the automobile. Forced placed insurance is generally very expensive.

Remember that Ohio law requires you to keep and provide proof of financial responsibility to satisfy your liability for personal injuries and property damage you cause to others. If you do not carry the required proof of financial responsibility, your driving privileges may be suspended.

The seller or financing agency may offer you credit life insurance and disability life insurance that would cover the payments on the vehicle in the event of your death, disability or unemployment. However, you should investigate such plans thoroughly to consider the cost and scope of the coverage.

Some people consider the purchase of “gap” insurance.&nbsp; If your vehicle is totaled, your insurance (or that of the person causing the accident) may pay you the value of the vehicle, which could be less than the amount owed to the lender.&nbsp; “Gap” insurance is designed to cover this shortfall between the value of the vehicle and any amount owed.

What should I know about credit cards?

Before you “charge it,” you should understand the obligations you are assuming and carefully read all applications for charge accounts and credit cards, as well as all charge slips and notices, before signing or accepting them.

Many businesses or credit card companies will allow you to defer the payment of amounts owed for 30 days without interest, while others add interest immediately. If stated in the credit agreement, Ohio law allows for a creditor to charge you as much as 25 percent annual interest on the unpaid balance.

How can I check my credit rating?

The amount of “credit power,” or your credit score, is based on many factors. These include income, payment history, secured and unsecured debt and the amount of credit available to you. Generally, you may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate for various types of loans if your credit score is higher. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) states that U.S. consumers are entitled to a free copy of their credit report each year.&nbsp; The nation’s credit reporting agencies have jointly developed the following website that you can use to get your free credit report:&nbsp; www.annualcreditreport.com, or you can request your free credit report by calling 877-322-8228.

The FCRA, which is enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, gives the consumer some rights against the use of wrong information in the files of credit bureaus. In part, the FCRA provides:


	You have the right to know the “nature and substance of all information.”
	You have the right to be told the source of almost all information if credit is denied.
	You have the right to be told the names of any firms that received your credit record during the previous six months (or two years if the report was furnished for employment purposes).
	You have the right to obtain the information free of charge from the credit agency if you have been denied credit, insurance or employment within 30 days of your inquiry. Otherwise, the reporting agency is permitted to charge a reasonable fee for making the disclosure.
	The credit bureau must investigate any information that you feel is incorrect. If the information proves incorrect, the agency must remove it from its files and, on your request, inform those who have received the information that it has been removed.
	After investigation, you can write a brief statement of your side of the story to put in the file. At your request, the agency must send your version of the dispute free of charge to anyone who has denied you credit within the past 30 days. If you ask, the agency also must send a copy of your version of the dispute to selected other businesses for a reasonable fee.
	You have the right to have a consumer report withheld from anyone who, under the law, does not have a legitimate business need for this information.


While the FCRA gives you certain rights, it also imposes some restrictions. It does not give you the right, when you visit the credit bureau, to receive a copy of or to physically handle your file, and it does not apply when you apply for commercial credit or business insurance.

What about bank charges?

Banks earn significant income from fees and charges. You may be charged an additional fee to use an ATM machine, particularly if it is not affiliated with your bank. Banks, as well as non-bank lenders, may also charge you an additional fee if you write a check or submit an online payment that is dishonored for insufficient funds, so use caution in keeping your checkbook balanced. Also, lenders may charge you a late payment fee if you do not pay the amount owed on time.

What other liability could I have?

It is possible to be subject to legal liability arising out of a transaction even though you have not signed anything or know of it. For example, one partner in a partnership may be held liable for acts or agreements of other partners, or a husband or wife may be responsible for a spouse’s charge accounts or installment purchases in certain situations, such as when both spouses’ names are on the account. Also, in some situations, parents may be liable for their children’s actions if property was damaged willfully or there is damage as a result of the use of a motor vehicle.

You also may be liable for a credit obligation if you have co-signed a credit agreement or guaranteed the payment of the debt of a friend or relative. Be sure you understand all the circumstances before you sign because your liability for the debt is the same as that of the maker (e.g., friend or relative) even though you have received no benefit.

You should also know that, when a lease is signed by more than one person, such as for a college apartment, each party is responsible for the full rent, not just his or her share (unless otherwise stipulated in the lease).

Student loans, whether signed by a parent or a student, cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, unless you can show that paying the loans will create “undue hardship,” which is very difficult to prove. A test commonly used by courts allows for a student loan to be discharged only when:&nbsp; 1) the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a “minimal” standard of living if forced to repay the loans; 2) additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the student loan repayment period; and 3) the debtor has made good-faith efforts to repay the loans. Student loans may also require the borrower to pay attorney fees and collection costs.

Check before you sign:


	Read every paper you are asked to sign, including the fine print.
	Don’t sign any paper that has blank spaces on it. Every space should be filled in.
	Compare the total charges—cost of item plus credit charges, etc.—with the cash price.
	Don’t rely on sales talk. Oral promises usually are not enforceable unless included in the contract.
	Don’t sign if you can't understand the words. Ask questions!
	Take your time. Don’t be in a hurry.


If in doubt, consult your attorney, who can do more good before you sign than after.

What is sealing a criminal record?

It is a legal process which limits access to criminal records.&nbsp; Sealed records are not public records and will not appear in an ordinary criminal record check.&nbsp; Only certain criminal justice professionals under limited circumstances may inspect a sealed conviction record.

What is a conviction?

You have been ‘convicted’ if you were found guilty, you plead guilty or if you plead no contest.&nbsp; You do not have to have been sent to prison or even paid a fine to have been convicted.

Why is sealing a criminal record important?

Most employers and landlords and every public housing authority does a criminal record search of applicants.&nbsp; A job applicant whose record has been sealed cannot be asked about a conviction unless it has a direct and substantial relationship to the job being sought.&nbsp; (However, state law prevents some businesses from hiring job applicants with criminal records.&nbsp; See below)

Who is eligible to have criminal records sealed?

An eligible offender has one felony conviction or one felony and one misdemeanor or two different misdemeanor convictions.&nbsp; A single incident may lead to several criminal charges, i.e. such as when a person is charged with assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest after a fight.&nbsp; If there are several convictions from acts committed at the same time, this is still considered one conviction.&nbsp; Related criminal acts committed within a three-month period can be counted as one conviction if they are listed in the same indictment or complaint even if they did not occur at the same time.&nbsp; A minor misdemeanor does not count as a ‘conviction’ under this statute.&nbsp;&nbsp; A minor misdemeanor usually results in a ticket not a court appearance.&nbsp; Having one or more minor misdemeanors will not prevent you from having a felony or misdemeanor convictions sealed.&nbsp; Juvenile offenses are not considered ‘convictions.’&nbsp; They may be expunged through juvenile court.

Can anyone get his/her record sealed?

&nbsp; No.&nbsp; A judge must agree to seal the records.

Not all convictions can be sealed.&nbsp; You cannot have any criminal or traffic charges pending at the time that you file the application for sealing.&nbsp; Your record cannot be sealed if:


	You received a mandatory prison term;
	You were convicted of a crime that involved sexual conduct or pandering obscenity to a minor;
	You were convicted of a first-degree misdemeanor that was an offense of violence;
	You were convicted of a first or second degree felony;
	You were convicted of a first degree misdemeanor or a felony and the victim was under 18 years of age;
	You were convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), driving under suspension (DUS), driving without a license, reckless operation or other traffic or motor vehicle crime;
	You used a firearm in committing the crime;
	You failed to appear (bail forfeiture) in a traffic case.


How long do I have to wait before filing to seal my records?

You will need to wait one year after the final discharge for a misdemeanor and three years after the final discharge for a felony.&nbsp; The final discharge happens when any court-ordered jail time, parole, probation or community service has been completed.&nbsp; All fines and court costs must be paid.

How does the court decide to seal a record?

The court will determine if the records are eligible to be sealed, that no criminal proceedings are currently pending, that the applicant has been rehabilitated, that the prosecutor has not filed an objection and that there is no legitimate need of the court to maintain the records.&nbsp; Sealing is at the discretion of the court.&nbsp; The judge will look at the crime and you and make a decision.&nbsp; If you have changed your life for the better and the judge feels it is in everyone’s best interest, the judge will order your record sealed.

What about employment after my record is sealed?&nbsp;

After a conviction is sealed, in most cases you do not need to list the conviction on a job application.&nbsp; However, you must list it if:


	The crime relates directly to the job you are applying for;
	The job involves the care of children, the elderly or disabled;


Certain employers such as day care centers, schools, nursing homes and hospitals are required to request a special records check from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCCI).&nbsp; Even if the conviction is sealed it will appear on the report.&nbsp; BCCI will inform the employer if the conviction is for an offense of violence or other listed offense.

Ohio is an ‘at will’ state which means that employees can be hired or fired as the employer chooses.&nbsp; If an employer learns of a prior conviction, even if it has been sealed, you could be fired.

Some employees have a written employment contract, such as a union contract.&nbsp; They can only be fired for ‘good cause.’&nbsp; If you have lied on your employment application, that would be ‘good cause.’&nbsp; However, if a sealed conviction is not mentioned, that should not be ‘good cause’ to fire you unless the offense directly relates to the job.

What if I was arrested but not convicted?

If you were found not guilty or the complaint against you was dismissed, you may file to have the record sealed at any time.&nbsp; If a ‘no bill’ was entered by a grand jury, you must wait two years to file.

What do I have to do?


	Get a copy of your final order from the court where you were convicted.
	Complete a Motion for Sealing of Criminal Record.
	File the forms with the Clerk of Courts in the county where you were convicted.
	Meet with the probation department and appear at a hearing in court.


Is this procedure free?

No.&nbsp; The filing fee in most courts is $50.&nbsp; You must pay with cash, a cashier’s check or money order.&nbsp; If you cannot pre-pay, you can file an Affidavit of Indigency.&nbsp; The affidavit must be notarized.

What if I have too many convictions?

You are not eligible for expungement.&nbsp; You may seek executive clemency or pardon by filing with the Ohio Parole Board.&nbsp; Don’t seek a pardon without proper legal advice.

Other Criminal Records",,Criminal,"Certificate of Qualification for Employment

Have you have been convicted of a crime?&nbsp; Are you having a hard time getting a job or occupational license?&nbsp; You may be helped by a new law.&nbsp; You can now seek a certificate of qualification for employment.

You will need to file a petition.&nbsp; You can file with the deputy director of the division of parole and community services if you served time in a state prison.&nbsp; Or you can file with the Court of Common Pleas if you didn’t serve time in a state prison.&nbsp; You must wait to file for a length of time after you are released from all sanctions. For a felony, you must wait one year.&nbsp; For a misdemeanor, you must wait six months.

In all cases, the Court of Common Pleas will request comments from all other Ohio courts where you have a conviction record.&nbsp; The court reviews your criminal history and any comments by prosecutors, victims, and other courts.&nbsp; The court can order an investigation.&nbsp; After all the requested information is received, the court will decide whether to issue a certificate within sixty days.

You must establish that granting the petition:


	Is required to help you in obtaining employment or an occupational license;
	Is needed in order for you to live a law-abiding life; and
	Granting will not pose an unreasonable threat to public or individual safety.


The court cannot issue a certificate that grants certain relief:


	Registration and other requirements for sex offenders;
	License suspension, cancellation or revocation which occurred due to 12+ points, vehicular homicide or vehicular manslaughter, DUI or failure to consent to blood, breath or urine test, if relief is available by law to grant limited driving privileges.
	Restrictions on employment as a prosecutor or law enforcement officer;
	License of health care professional if convicted of, or eligible for intervention in lieu of conviction, for aggravated murder, murder, voluntary manslaughter; felonious assault; kidnapping; rape, sexual battery, gross sexual imposition; aggravated arson; aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary; or unlawful distribution of abortion inducing drug;
	Immediate suspension of health care professional license for addiction or improperly distributing a controlled substance;
	Denial of employment at a pain clinic (which is a category III distributor of dangerous drugs);
	Suspension of license of health care professional for failure to pay child support;


The court will notify you if it denies your petition or if any conditions are placed on your future application.&nbsp; Appeal to Ct of App available under abuse of discretion standard.

The court will make a case-by-case decision as to occupational licenses.

There is no relief from mandatory civil sanctions.&nbsp; You cannot be an elector, juror, petition circulator or hold position of honor, trust or profit.

The certificate will be revoked if you are convicted of a felony.

Love ≠ Forced Sex.&nbsp; It’s a crime to force anyone to have sex without consent.&nbsp;


	Consent means giving or getting a ‘yes.’&nbsp; Silence is not consent.
	Consent is not ‘yes’ given under threat or coercion.
	Consenting to one activity is not consent for every activity.&nbsp;
	Consent in the past is not consent for every future act.&nbsp;
	A person who is drunk, high, unconscious or asleep cannot give consent.
	Consent is not given by wearing sexy clothes, dancing or flirting.&nbsp;
	Not fighting back is not consent.


A person you know, or even someone you love, may commit a sexual assault against you. You can’t always avoid a sexual assault.&nbsp; It’s not your fault.

Love ≠ Coercion. &nbsp;Force isn’t just physical pressure. Coercion can be social or emotional pressure.&nbsp; Coercion uses guilt or your better nature against you:

&nbsp;

“If you really loved me, you’d do it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ll just tell everyone we did.”

“You can’t just make a guy stop.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tonight’s perfect.&nbsp; Why ruin it?”

“You’ve got me all worked up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You worked hard.&nbsp; It would be a shame not to get an A”

Think about what you would say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t owe you an explanation or anything all""

“If you love me, you would respect what I want.” &nbsp;&nbsp;“I do like you but I’m not ready for sex.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Steps you can take to help prevent an assault: 


	Get to a safe place.
	Look for an exit or public space.
	If you are at a party or event, ask someone you trust to stay with you or not leave without you.
	Sign up for a ride-sharing program or add a taxi # to your cell phone.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

● Check out C.A.R.E. on www.RAINN.org. Plan with your friends and dorm mates how to safety step in to help each other or another friend.

&nbsp;


	Create a distraction-“Let’s go get pizza.”&nbsp; “This party is lame.&nbsp; Let’s go.”
	Ask directly- “Want me to stay with you?” “Need a ride?”
	Refer to authority- Alert a security guard or bartender.&nbsp; Call 911.
	Enlist others- Ask friends to help you intervene or escort the person at risk.


&nbsp;

●&nbsp; Check in with yourself.&nbsp; Did you plan to do what you are doing? With the person who is urging you to do it?&nbsp; If you are feeling out of control, get to a friend and a safe place.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

● Be aware of your surroundings. Especially if walking or running alone, avoid the distraction of talking on a cellphone or using both earbuds. Don’t take the same route every time. Stay in busy, well-lit areas, especially at night. Use a campus security escort.&nbsp;

	Preserve the evidence.&nbsp; Do not bathe, brush, comb or clean any part of your body.&nbsp; Do not wash or change your clothes.&nbsp; Don’t touch or change anything at the scene of the assault.
	Get to a hospital ER as soon as possible.&nbsp; Ask for a SANE nurse (sexual assault nurse examiner).&nbsp; You can be tested for STDs and pregnancy.&nbsp; Even if you’re not sure you want to press charges, the rape kit preserves evidence until you are ready to decide what to do.&nbsp;
	A rape crisis counselor can help you during this process.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling safe after an assault.

● If you feel more comfortable, get help at an off-campus sexual assault service provider, rape crisis center or domestic violence shelter.

● You can get a protection order (even if you don’t file criminal charges or aren’t a U.S. citizen).&nbsp; A person who has who been sexually assaulted can seek a protection order.&nbsp; A court also can grant a protection order against anyone helping or participating in a sexual assault.&nbsp; There are different types of protection orders.&nbsp; Talk to a rape crisis counselor or domestic violence advocate about which best protects you.&nbsp;

	seven or more consecutive school days,
	ten or more school days in one school month, or
	fifteen or more school days in a school year.


A “legitimate excuse for absence” means that the child is excused from attendance at school for the specific reasons below:&nbsp;

	the child’s mental condition does not permit attendance at school.&nbsp; This must be certified in writing by a licensed physician, a licensed psychologist, a licensed school psychologist or a certificated school psychologist;
	and provision is made for the appropriate instruction of the child


If your child meets the definition of a ‘child with a disability’ free appropriate education should be provided by the public school system.&nbsp; Appropriate education should be determined by the needs of your child.&nbsp; If you have not done so, you should contact the principal of your child’s school to request appropriate education for your child.

For more information visit their website at&nbsp;http://dodd.ohio.gov.

All students are entitled to a free, appropriate public education.&nbsp; Schools have a duty to identify and help any ""child with a disability that affects learning.""&nbsp; This applies to persons from ages 3 to 22.&nbsp; A parent, guardian or a school can request that a child be evaluated to determine if child has a disability that affects learning.

A ""child with a disability"" includes children with mental retardation, hearing impairments, speech or language impairments, visual impairments, emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments or specific learning disabilities.

If child qualifies for special services, the school and the parent or guardian must meet to develop an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).&nbsp; An IEP sets out educational goals and services to help the child to meet those goals.

The school system must deliver the services in the ‘least restrictive environment.’ That could mean keeping the child in regular classes with assistance from the classroom teacher or other personnel.

A parent may disagree with the school system at any stage.&nbsp; A parent may disagree about identification, testing, IEP development and special services delivery process.&nbsp; The parent may seek to appeal the schools actions through a ‘due process’ hearing. &nbsp;The parent may be represented at any stage of the process.&nbsp; Attorney fees may be awarded if the parent prevails at the due process hearing.

Assistance may be available from the Ohio Legal Rights Service (OLRS).&nbsp; The OLRS is an independent state agency which advocates for persons with disabilities.&nbsp; OLRS can be reached at 8 East Long Street, Suite 500 Columbus, Ohio 43215-2999 telephone : 614-466-7264 or 1-800-282-9181 (toll free in Ohio) TTY: 614-728-2553 or 1-800-858-3542 (Toll free in Ohio) Fax: 614-644-1888 or on the internet at:  olrs.ohio.gov&nbsp;

If an agreement between the employer and a terminated employee cannot be reached, the OCRC orders a full investigation.&nbsp; The OCRC investigator acts as a neutral fact-finder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The OCRC determines whether or not ""it is probable"" the discrimination occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the facts support a finding of ""no cause"", the complaint is referred back to the OCRC with a recommendation for dismissal. This has occurred if you receive a ‘no finding’ letter.
You have the right to appeal this decision to the Court of Common Pleas.&nbsp; The court would review the record to determine if the OCRC's decision was arbitrary, unlawful or capricious.&nbsp; The Attorney General represents the OCRC. You would represent yourself or hire an attorney.

State and federal laws protect employees against certain types of discrimination.&nbsp; Employers cannot discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, military status, national origin, disability, age or ancestry.&nbsp; These are called ‘protected classes.’&nbsp;

In a lawsuit, employees must show that:


	they belong to a ‘protected’ class;
	they were fired because they belong to the class
	they have the ability to perform the required work, and
	they were replaced by, or that the discharge permitted the retention of, a person not belonging to the protected class.



The employer must show that:


	an employee was fired for legitimate reasons like poor work or absenteeism;
	it was not possible to reasonably accommodate a disability;
	the employee is a health or safety risk to others.&nbsp; If your employer raises these defenses, you have the burden of convincing the court that the employer’s reasons were mere ‘pretext’ for the unlawful discrimination.&nbsp;



A discrimination lawsuit is usually filed after a determination by the OCRC that it is probable that illegal discrimination occurred.&nbsp; If you are considering whether to file a lawsuit, you should consult an attorney experienced in this complicated area of law immediately.&nbsp; You have only a limited time to file in court.&nbsp; Normally, you have only ninety (90) days from the date of the OCRC notice to file a lawsuit.

	the employee has civil service protection,
	the employer violated state or federal discrimination laws,
	the violation is based on a public policy such as ""whistle blowing,""

You can complain to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC) if you feel that an employer has discriminated against you.&nbsp; An employee must file a complaint within 180 days.&nbsp; Contact the Akron regional office at 330-643-3100 for the specific complaint form.&nbsp;

Often but not always, a lawsuit is filed after an investigation by the OCRC.&nbsp; If you are considering a lawsuit, you should contact an attorney early on. There are many options in discrimination lawsuits based on various laws and different facts.&nbsp; Each discrimination lawsuit is different.&nbsp; A lawyer can help you decide a course of action.&nbsp;

If you do file an OCRC complaint, an OCRC representative will contact the employer to settle the matter.&nbsp; If an agreement between the employer and the employee cannot be reached, the OCRC can order a full investigation.&nbsp; If a full investigation is ordered, the OCRC investigator acts as a neutral fact-finder.&nbsp; The investigator can interview witnesses, review documents and file a report.&nbsp; The report includes a recommendation to OCRC.&nbsp;&nbsp; The OCRC decides whether or not the discrimination might have occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the OCRC does an investigation and decides discrimination did not occur – called a ‘no cause’ finding – you will get a letter from OCRC telling you there is ‘no cause’ to believe discrimination occurred.&nbsp; The complaint is referred back to the OCRC with a recommendation for dismissal.&nbsp; OCRC will then dismiss the complaint.&nbsp; This dismissal can be appealed to a Court of Common Pleas.&nbsp;

If the OCRC finds there is ""probable cause"" that the employer has discriminated, the OCRC may try to settle the matter.&nbsp; The OCRC may decide to take no action.&nbsp; If so, you can decide whether to file a lawsuit at this point.&nbsp;

OCRC may issue a formal complaint against the employer if no settlement is reached.&nbsp; A formal hearing is held.&nbsp; An OCRC attorney represents the employee indirectly.&nbsp; The OCRC decides if the employer has discriminated.&nbsp; If so, the OCRC can award back pay, future pay, damages and job reinstatement.&nbsp;

A discrimination lawsuit based on state law can be filed at many different points.&nbsp; It can be filed after a determination by the OCRC that it is probable that illegal discrimination occurred.&nbsp; However, a discrimination lawsuit can be filed even if the OCRC found ‘no cause’ to believe discrimination occurred.&nbsp; If you are considering whether to file a lawsuit, you should consult an attorney experienced in this complicated area of law immediately.&nbsp;

This fact sheet is not intended to provide legal advice.&nbsp; The laws protecting employees
may be changing in the near future.&nbsp; The process may be more complicated and the time frames shorter.&nbsp; For this reason, you should seek legal advice before taking any action.

3.) Finally, you can sue your previous employer in Small Claims Court.&nbsp; You can sue for up to $3000.00 in Small Claims Court.&nbsp; The court is set up to be user-friendly to persons representing themselves.&nbsp;

Your complaint must be filed in the court for the location where you worked, where you hired on or where your employer has a place of business.&nbsp; To win your case, you will need to prove the amount your employer agreed to pay you and that you worked the hours.&nbsp; Proof that you worked could come from your statement in court.&nbsp; You will need more proof such as statements in court (not written) from your co-workers.&nbsp; Other proof could be time records kept by you or your employer or other evidence.&nbsp;

Sometimes employers counterclaim and argue that you owe them money for some reason.&nbsp; Be prepared to present evidence about that too.&nbsp;

Generally, a two-year statute of limitations applies to the recovery of back pay.&nbsp; In the case of willful violations, a three-year statute of limitations applies.&nbsp; That means you must file a complaint within that time frame.

Once you obtain a judgment from the court you will then have to pursue collection by filing for a debtor’s exam and for a bank attachment.

You may want to consult with a private employment law attorney for additional advice.

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets the minimum wage, overtime pay, and recordkeeping standards.&nbsp; FLSA standards apply to employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments.&nbsp; Most employees are covered; independent contractors and highly paid managers are not.&nbsp; More than 130 million American workers are protected (or ""covered"") by the FLSA, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor.

At this time, Ohio has a minimum wage of $8.10 per hour.&nbsp; The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.&nbsp; If an employee is covered by both state and federal minimum wage laws, the employee is entitled to the higher minimum wage.

Generally, an employer must pay at least time and a half for each hour worked beyond the regular 40 hour work week.&nbsp; This applies to covered ‘nonexempt’ employees.&nbsp; A regular work week is any fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours during seven consecutive 24-hour periods.

There is no limit on the number of hours employees 16 years or older may work in any workweek.&nbsp; The FLSA does not require overtime pay for work on weekends, holidays, or regular days of rest unless overtime is worked on such days.

Hours worked ordinarily include all the time during which an employee is required to be on the employer’s premises, on duty, or at a workplace.

Employers must display an official poster with the FLSA standards.&nbsp; Employers must also keep employee time and pay records.

You could contact the U.S. Department of Labor, Division of Wages and Hours at (866) 4-USWAGE.

Before using the court system, you must decide which court to use.&nbsp; If the amount of your unpaid wages is less than $3,000.00, you may find the Small Claims court to be cheap and fast.&nbsp; Please review our fact sheet which explains the procedure for filing a complaint in small claims court.&nbsp; If your wage claim is over $3000 you should consider hiring an attorney,

MINIMUM WAGE LAWS

Most lawsuits for wages are based on the employer's agreement to pay you in exchange for the work you do.&nbsp; There are also federal and state minimum wage laws.&nbsp; Government agencies may help you get the minimum wage, but they will not get you any higher amount your employer agreed to pay you.

The federal minimum wage law requires certain employers to pay at least the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour.&nbsp; Also, the employer must pay at least time and a half for each hour worked beyond the regular 40 hour work week.&nbsp; This federal law applies to employers with over $500,000 a year in gross sales and does business across state lines.&nbsp; The U.S. Department of Labor, Division of Wages and Hours investigates violations of federal minimum wage laws.&nbsp; Call (866) 4-USWAGE.&nbsp;

The Ohio minimum wage law requires certain employers to pay at least the Ohio minimum wage, which is currently $8.10 per hour.&nbsp; Ohio minimum wage law may cover your employer if federal law does not.&nbsp; You can also file a claim with the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Labor and Worker Safety at 614-496-9076 or at www.com.ohio.gov/laws/MWOTComplaint.aspx.&nbsp;

You have two years from the date your wages were not paid in which to sue.&nbsp; Under federal law, you may recover your unpaid minimum wage and ""liquidated damages.""&nbsp; The court may award you attorney fees and costs.&nbsp; If your employer has violated the Ohio minimum wage law, you may recover the unpaid minimum wages, attorney fees, and costs.&nbsp;

Allows certain employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year.&nbsp; It requires that group health benefits be maintained during the leave.&nbsp;

Leave must be granted for any of the following reasons:


	for the birth and care of a newborn child of an employee;
	for placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care;
	to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or
	to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition; or
	to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin who is a current servicemember with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty, up to a total of 26 workweeks; or
	to assist a spouse, son, daughter, or parent on active duty (or soon to be) in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation.&nbsp; Leave must relate to a short notice of deployment (under 7 days); making child care, financial or legal arrangements; military activities; or short-term leave (5 days).


To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must:


	work for an employer that is a public agency, public or private elementary or secondary school, or company with 50 or more employees; and
	have worked for the employer for over a year; and
	have worked at least 1,250 hours in the previous 12 months; and
	work at a location where at least 50 co-employees work within 75 miles.


Leave is limited to a combined total of 26 work weeks for any FMLA-qualifying reason during the “single 12-month period.”&nbsp; Only 12 of the 26 weeks total may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason other than to care for a covered service member.

FMLA leave may be taken intermittently and not all at one time.

Spouses employed by the same employer are limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks in a “single 12-month period” if the leave is to care for a covered service member, birth of a newborn child, adoption or foster care for a child, or to care for a parent who has a serious health condition.

Special rules apply to school employees.&nbsp; Rules concerning service members may change.&nbsp; For more specific information go to the Department of Labor website: www.dol.gov

You can file a claim for unemployment compensation benefits at unemployment.ohio.gov, by telephone at 1-877-OHIOJOB (644-6562) Monday to Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (except holidays), or at any “one stop” office of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. Computers are available at one stop centers or local libraries to file a new claim or check an existing claim.

To receive benefits you must:


	have worked in covered employment
	your employer has to have paid into the system (not “under the table”)
	have worked in covered employment for enough time,
	20 weeks in the first 4 quarters of the last 5 quarters; or
	20 weeks in the last 4 quarters
	have earned enough weekly wages
	$222 or more per week for the 20 weeks (for 2012; amount changes often))
	you must be unemployed for a proper reason
	were not fired with just cause
	did not quit without just cause
	you must be able to work and be actively seeking work.


The Department will contact your employer about your pay and the reason why you left your job. Your employer has a financial reason to dispute your claim. Unemployment insurance premiums are based on how many claims are paid. However, it’s the Department that decides your claim based on the rules. The Department can hold an informal fact finding if your employer disputes your eligibility for benefits.

You will receive two notices of review after you have filed your claim. You must win both to receive benefits:


	The Notice of Determination of Benefit Rights (UC-465NF) will review whether your application is valid and whether you have worked enough covered hours. It will state the date your benefit year begins and the weekly amount you may be eligible to receive.
	The Determination of Benefits (UC-465F) will state whether your claim for a particular week of benefits is allowed. This review can cover the reason that you became unemployed, whether you had pay attributed to you during the week in question, were available for work, or otherwise were eligible.


APPEALING A DECISION: Reconsideration and Hearing

If you are denied benefits, you can appeal. You only have 21 days from the date the notice was mailed to file a written request for reconsideration. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU APPEAL WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD! If your appeal is late, it is denied.

You must keep looking for work, record job search attempts and follow Department requests during the appeal process.

If you receive benefits, your employer may request reconsideration. You will receive a notice if this happens.

If you lose the reconsideration, you have 21 days from the date of mailing to request a hearing. You must file a written appeal within this time limit.

If your employer appeals from a decision that was in your favor, you will receive a notice. If your employer ultimately wins on appeal, you will have an “overpayment” for any checks you received. You will have to pay the money back. If no fraud is involved, the State has 3 years to recover the money. It is important that you take any appeal by your employer seriously.

APPEAL HEARINGS

After a hearing is requested, you will receive a notice that a hearing has been scheduled before a hearing officer of the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission. Read this notice carefully. This notice will contain the date, time and location of the hearing.

There are two types of hearing: In-person Hearings and Telephone Hearings. You should go to the hearing to present evidence on your own behalf even if you have already received your unemployment checks.

Telephone hearings are conference calls between the hearing officer, the employer and you. The procedure will be explained in your hearing notice. The notice will state the call-in telephone number that you must call for the hearing. If you want an in-person hearing instead of by telephone, you must request it immediately.

You can subpoena witnesses and documents to your hearing. You need to do this well in advance. It is important to fully present your case. If you have evidence or witnesses, this is the time to make sure that evidence gets into your record. However, witnesses who still work for your employer likely want to keep their jobs. Their testimony may or may not help you.

Legal Aid provides representation to eligible clients at the hearing level. Call Legal Aid as soon as you request a hearing and again when you get notice of your hearing.

FURTHER APPEAL

If you lose your hearing, you have 21 days to appeal. File a written Application to Institute Further Appeal with the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission. You must appeal within this time limit.

If you lose, you have thirty days from the mailing date on the Review Commission’s decision to file an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas in your county. If you do not, the decision is final. The court will review the documents and the transcript of the hearing. There is no new hearing. It will only reverse the Commission’s decision if there was an error of law or if a factual finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The Court will not ‘second guess’ a Hearing Officer’s factual finding if there was a dispute that could reasonably have gone either way.

The UCRC will issue a written decision.&nbsp; If your request for review is allowed, the UCRC may issue a decision based on the record of the earlier hearing or hold a further hearing.

Collection of Overpayment

If your appeal is denied, you may receive notice to repay an unemployment benefit overpayment.&nbsp; If the overpayment is considered a ""no fraud"" overpayment, ODJFS can attempt to collect from you for the next three (3) years.&nbsp; Overpayments, not paid within 45 days, may be referred to the Ohio Attorney General for collection.&nbsp; The Attorney General's Office pursues repayment through various legal options. It can put liens against property, intercept state income tax refunds or take other action.&nbsp; If the overpayment was made through “fraud,” criminal sanctions may be pursued if full repayment is not made promptly.

Overpayment of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)

The rules are different for emergency benefits.&nbsp; The entire amount of a weekly benefit is withheld until the EUC overpayment is paid.

Apply for the Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), Winter Crisis Program (WCP), Summer Crisis Program (SCP), Percentage of Income Payment Plan Plus (PIPP Plus) and Home Weatherization Assistance Program (HWAP) on line at http://development.ohio.gov/

For WCP and SCP, the utility bill must be in the name of an eligible household member. An appointment is required at a local community action agency.

ELIGIBILITY FOR ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS:

HEAP is designed to assist eligible low-income Ohioans with their winter heating bills. Households may be eligible for assistance from HEAP, WCP, SCP, or HWAP if the household income is at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. Households may be eligible for assistance from PIPP Plus if the household income is at or below 150% of the federal poverty guidelines. Once your application has been processed, you will receive a notification letter telling you whether or not you are eligible for bill payment assistance. If you are eligible, the amount of your benefit will depend on federal funding levels, how many people live with you, total household income, and the primary fuel you

use to heat your home. In most cases, benefits will be a credit applied to your energy bill by your utility company. This is a once a year benefit.

If you are eligible for weatherization services, your application will be obtainable by the agency providing services in your area. The types of assistance you receive will be based on your home’s energy efficiency. If you live in federally subsidized housing and have a utility bill in your name, you may be eligible for assistance.

Residents of any licensed medical facility (hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility) or publicly operated community residence (example: YMCA) are ineligible. Boarding/rooming houses, group homes, or emergency shelters are ineligible for payment assistance, but may be eligible for weatherization services. All persons who share a common kitchen or bath are considered members of the same household and must apply on one application.

PERCENTAGE OF INCOME PAYMENT PlAN Plus (PIPP Plus)

PIPP Plus is a special payment plan that requires eligible customers to pay a portion of their household income each month to maintain utility service. PIPP Plus protects customers from disconnection, as long as they follow the

program’s rules about monthly payments. All gas and electric companies regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) must offer this plan to their customers. PIPP Plus is not available to customers of rural electric co-ops, municipal utilities, or users of delivered fuels. The utility bill must be in the name of the PIPP Plus applicant. The first PIPP Plus installment must be paid upon enrollment in order to receive the arrearage credit.

HOME WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (HWAP)

HWAP is a federally-funded, low-income residential energy efficiency program that reduces the energy use of qualified households. HWAP services include attic, wall, and basement insulation; air leakage reduction; heating system repairs or replacements; electric base load measures that address lighting and appliance efficiency; and health and safety inspections and testing. Services are based on the structure and energy use of the home. HWAP is administered locally by community action, social service, and local government agencies.

INCOME DEFINITION

Household income is defined as the gross income of all household members, except wage or salary income earned by dependent minors under 18 years of age. Heads of household and spouses may never be considered as minors. Gross income includes, but is not limited to, wages (excluding documented health insurance premiums), interest, annuities, pensions, Social Security (excluding Medicare premiums), retirement, employment disability, public assistance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), alimony, child support, unemployment benefits, Workers’ Compensation, and any other indirect income such as utility allowances.

Custody
Emergency
Abduction",,Family Law,"This fact sheet can help you, an unmarried mother, understand your right to custody of your child. This fact sheet assumes:


	you and the father of the child have never married each other;
	you were not married to anyone else when the child was born;
	there are no court orders giving anyone custody or visitation with the child.


If any of these facts are not true, this information might not apply to you.

The Law Is Clear:&nbsp;An unmarried woman who gives birth to a child has custody of the child automatically. The law states:


“An unmarried female who gives birth to a child is the sole residential parent and legal custodian of the child until a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order designating another person as the residential parent and legal custodian. A court designating the residential parent and legal custodian of a child described in this section shall treat the Mother and Father as standing upon an equality when making the designation.” (Ohio Revised Code 3109.042)


You have legal custody of your child without having to go to court. That means you have all the rights of a parent:


	the right to decide who sees the child and for how long;
	the right to restrict visitation;
	the right to enroll the child in school;
	the right to obtain medical treatment;
	the right to get public benefits for the child; and
	the right to do anything else a parent with legal custody can do.


Courts Can Still Decide Custody:&nbsp;If the child’s father files in court for custody, the court will decide custody based on the facts. The law does not mean the Court will automatically give you legal custody. This is true even if the child has been living with you. The Court must give each parent an equal opportunity to prove that he or she is the better parent to have custody.

When deciding custody, the Court will look at the ‘best interest of the child.’ In general, the court will consider who best met the needs of the child.

The court will look at who has done most of the feeding and bathing, arranging for medical care and education, preparing the child for sleep and arranging for babysitters, etc. The Court will also look at other factors such as:


	the mental and physical health of the parents,
	whether either parent has a history of domestic violence;
	the child’s relationship with other family members;
	whether a parent hasn’t paid child support; and
	which parent is more likely to honor visitation rights.


Allowing Visitation:&nbsp;Unless you have concerns for the health or safety of the child during visitation, you should consider allowing reasonable visitation. Courts consider which parent is more likely to allow the other parent time with the child. In the future, the father may ask a Court to decide custody of your child. The court will consider whether you have permitted visitation. One way to prove that you will allow visitation with the father in the future is to allow visitation now. It’s a good idea even if there is no court order that requires it. However, if the father has threatened to harm or flee with the child, you have no duty to allow visits.

This does not mean you have to go looking for the father. It means that if he is interested in visiting with the child, you should set up a meaningful schedule. In that way, the father will not be able to prove that you would deny him visits.

Courts prefer that parents to make their own arrangements. If they can’t, the court will order a standard schedule if the father requests it. This assumes that the father is suitable to care for the child. Each Court of Common Pleas has a local standard visitation schedule. You can obtain a copy at the Clerk of Courts, on-line or at your local Legal Aid office.

Paternity And Child Support:&nbsp;If you seek child support, you will be required to help legally establish the paternity. That is to determine who the father of the child is. A paternity order has no effect on an unmarried mother’s custody of the child. Fathers must seek an order in court to obtain a visitation or change custody. The court should not automatically issue a custody or visitation order.

If paternity has not been established, your local Child Support Enforcement Agency can help you establish paternity and get child support. You cannot get child support until paternity is established.

The Ohio Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics, keeps birth and adoption records of persons born in Ohio and adopted anywhere in the United&nbsp; States.&nbsp; For more information see www.odh.ohio.gov for information and forms.&nbsp; Look for ‘adoption information’ in the a to z search.&nbsp;

Adoptions before 1964:&nbsp; You will need to complete an affidavit and have it notarized.&nbsp; Send it with copies of two pieces of identification and a fee.&nbsp; Obtain the forms from the Department of Health.&nbsp; This file will not include medical information.&nbsp;

Adoptions between January 1, 1964 and September 18, 1996:&nbsp; These adoption records are sealed and only opened by a probate court order.&nbsp;

Adoptions after September 18, 1996:&nbsp; These adoption records are open to the adopted person over age 21.&nbsp; Birth information will be disclosed if the biological parents or a biological sibling have signed an authorization to release the information.&nbsp; This form must have been registered with the Department of Health.&nbsp;&nbsp; The adopted person must complete a request form and provide copies of two forms of identification.&nbsp;

For more information, use the website links or contact the Ohio Department of Health, customer service team at&nbsp; 614-466-2531. Request a form or mail a request to Office of Vital Statistics, P.O. 15098, Columbus, Ohio 43215.

Adopted persons may also petition Probate Court. 
You may file a petition to seek your birth name and the identity of your biological parents.&nbsp; This petition must be filed in the probate court of the county where you live or where the adoption occurred.&nbsp; There is a filing fee.

The probate court will appoint an agency to investigate.&nbsp; The probate judge will order the Department of Health to give the agency a copy of your original birth record or the name of the court that ordered the adoption.&nbsp; This should happen within ninety days or so.&nbsp;&nbsp; The agency will investigate to determine if:


	You were adopted;
	a consent has been filed by one or both of your biological parents authorizing the release of identifying information; and
	one or both of your biological parents are deceased.&nbsp;


The agency will report its findings to the Probate Court.&nbsp; A copy of your original birth record will be attached to the report. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The Probate Court may release information about your birth name and the identity of your biological parents only if:


	the parent is deceased;&nbsp; or
	the parent or biological sibling has signed to authorize the release of the identifying information.&nbsp;


However, if both biological parents are still living and a release is not in the file, the petition will not be granted until releases are signed.

How can I find out about my medical background?&nbsp;

You may request the social and medical histories of your biological parents.&nbsp; Ask the clerk of the probate court for a request form.&nbsp; These histories are now kept as part of the permanent record in probate court.&nbsp; Older adoption files may not contain these records.&nbsp; You can also ask to be updated if any new information is made available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to give written notice of a change of address to the court if you move.

49,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/51,Change of Custody Fact Sheet,Custody,,Family Law,"An Ohio court cannot change custody from you to the other parent unless certain requirements of the law are met.&nbsp; The court must review certain facts in deciding whether to change custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The court must decide if there has been a “change of circumstances.”&nbsp; This change of circumstances can be the child’s or the custodial parent’s (or a parent in shared parenting plan).&nbsp; The change of circumstance must have occurred after the last custody order.&nbsp; Issues the court has heard and decided cannot be raised again.&nbsp; New issues could include the mental health of the custodial parent, frequent changes of residence, abuse or neglect of the child or his education, or substance abuse.&nbsp; Other issues may be considered.&nbsp; However, the situation must have a direct, adverse impact on the child.&nbsp; Often, a parent seeking custody will try to combine minor events or situations to show that there has been a change in circumstance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Once the court finds that a “change of circumstances” has occurred, the court must determine if:


	the present custodian has agreed to the change of custody;
	the child has been placed in the other parent’s home by the custodial parent and is integrated into that home; or
	the harm likely to be caused by the change of environment is outweighed by the benefit of placing the child in the other home.&nbsp;


Ohio law creates a presumption in favor of keeping the child with the current custodian.&nbsp; However, if there’s enough evidence the court will change custody.&nbsp; The court must consider the following factors in deciding what is in the child’s “best interest:”


	the wishes of each parent;
	the wishes and concerns of the child;
	the child’s interaction with parents, family and others such as neighbors, friends, teachers;
	the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community;
	the mental and physical health of all persons involved;
	the parent most likely to facilitate visitation;
	whether a parent has failed to pay child support;
	whether the custodial parent has willfully denied visitation to the other parent;
	whether either parent is planning to establish an out-of-state residence;
	whether either parent has physically or sexually abused children; and
	whether either parent has committed domestic violence involving a family or household member.


Any mature child may state an opinion as to who should be the legal custodian.&nbsp; The child’s wishes are one of many factors the court will review.&nbsp; The court may interview a child in chambers (privately) if either parent requests it.

The court may appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL).&nbsp; A GAL will investigate and report to the court.&nbsp; The GAL will talk with parents, teachers, counselors and others.&nbsp; The GAL will review records.&nbsp; The GAL may make home visits.&nbsp; The GAL also will talk with the child.&nbsp; Parents should cooperate with any guardian ad litem appointed to a case.&nbsp; Provide the names and telephone numbers for your child's teachers, counselors, pediatrician and others who may have knowledge of your child's needs and the environment.

The court may order an investigation.&nbsp; The investigator will determine the character, family relations, past conduct, earning ability and financial worth of each parent.&nbsp; The court can order the parents and minor children to submit to medical, psychological or psychiatric examination.&nbsp;

If the court determines neither parent should have custody, the court can award custody to a relative.&nbsp; The court can also move the case into juvenile court if needed.

If the other parent has filed for custody or shared parenting and you object, you should consult with a lawyer as soon as possible.&nbsp;

50,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/52,Grandparent Power of Attorney,Grandparent Custody/Visitation/Adoption Issues,,Family Law,"What is a Grandparent Power of Attorney (POA)? 

A Grandparent POA is a legal document giving a grandparent temporary authority to make decisions about a grandchild’s care.

A Grandparent POA does not:


	Grant the grandparent legal custody
	Affect the enforcement of a child support order
	Affect the rights of the child’s parents, guardian or custodian in any future legal proceeding;


What does a Grandparent POA do? It gives the grandparent legal authority to:


	Enroll the child in school
	Access the child’s school information
	Provide consent for school activities
	Be involved in the child’s educational planning
	Arrange for the child’s medical, dental and psychological treatment


Who creates the Grandparent POA? Only a custodial parent, guardian or legal custodian of a child may create a Grandparent POA.

Must both parents sign a Grandparent POA? It depends.

A POA may be signed by only one parent if:


	The parent is designated by court order as residential parent and legal custodian; or
	There is no order designating the child’s parent as the residential parent and legal custodian and the child lives a majority of the school year with that parent.


A POA must be signed by both parents if:


	The parents are married to each other and are living as husband and wife
	There is a shared parenting court order and both parents share legal custody


Can any relative of the child be given a Grandparent POA? No, only grandparents.

When can a Grandparent POA be created? It can be created only if:


	The parent is unable to care for the child due to the parent’s serious illness or physical or mental condition or to provide financial support or parental guidance
	The parent is homeless or without a residence
	The parent is in or is about to enter a residential treatment program for substance abuse
	The parent has a well-founded belief that having a grandparent temporarily care for the child is in the child’s best interest. However, it may not be created for the sole purpose of changing schools to participate in academic or sports programs. (Falsification, 1st degree misdemeanor).


What if there is a case already pending? 

A Grandparent POA is not effective if there is:


	A proceeding to appoint a guardian
	A proceeding for the adoption of the child
	A divorce proceeding
	A dissolution of marriage
	A legal separation proceeding
	An annulment proceeding
	A proceeding to allocate parental rights and responsibilities
	A proceeding where the child is alleged to be dependent, neglected or abused
	The child is in shelter care or detention and no hearing has yet been held
	The child is the subject of a temporary custody order for emergency medical treatment


How is a Grandparent POA created? A Power of Attorney form must be completed and signed in front of a notary public by the parent(s), (or custodial parent, guardian or legal custodian) and by the grandparent being given authority

What are the other requirements after the Grandparent POA is created? 


	Either parent who did not sign must be sent notice by certified mail within 5 days. The notice must state the grandparent’s name and address.
	It must be filed in court within the next 5 days along with the certified mail receipt showing notice was sent to the parent(s). File the original POA with the Juvenile Court in the county where the grandparent lives. If another court in the past has made a custody order for the child, the POA must be filed in that court. There is no filing fee.


Does the non-custodial parent always have to be notified? The non-custodial parent does not have to be notified if:


	A court order prohibits that parent from receiving a notice of change of residence of the child
	That parent’s parental rights have been terminated by a Juvenile Court order
	That parent cannot be located with reasonable efforts
	Both parents sign the Power of Attorney


Is there a court hearing after the Grandparent POA is filed? No court hearing is required. However, if the non-custodial parent seeks custody of the child, a hearing will be held.

What could the court do at this hearing? The court may take any of the following actions:


	Approve the Grandparent Power of Attorney
	Terminate the Grandparent Power of Attorney and order the child returned.
	Treat the filing of the Grandparent POA as a petition for legal custody and award legal custody of the child to the grandparent.


How long is the Grandparent POA valid? It ends at:


	The child stops living with the grandparent
	The child dies
	Designated grandparent dies
	It is terminated by court order
	The parent revokes and gives written notice to the grandparent and the court where the POA was filed.


What must I do if the Grandparent POA is revoked? Within 5 days, the grandparent must file a copy of the revocation with the court. Also, the grandparent must send written notice within 7 days to:


	The child’s school
	The child’s health care providers
	The child’s health insurance coverage provider
	Any other person or entity that has an ongoing relationship with the child
	The Court in which the POA was filed after it was created
	The non-custodial parent, if notice was provided at the time of it was created


What if my grandchild was left in my care and I cannot locate the parents? You may be eligible to create a Caretaker Authorization Affidavit.

Can I contest a revocation of my Grandparent POA? Yes.&nbsp; If the child is removed from your home or you received written notice of revocation and you believe that the revocation is not within the best interest of the child, you can file a complaint with the Juvenile Court seeking a determination of custody. This complaint must be filed within 14 days of revocation.&nbsp; You may retain custody of the child during the 14 day period for filing a complaint, if you file, or until the court orders otherwise.

51,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/53,Grandparent Visitation,Grandparent Custody/Visitation/Adoption Issues,,Family Law,"Who can ask for court-ordered Grandparent Visitation?

&nbsp;

In Ohio, grandparents and other relatives can obtain an order of visitation with a child only under certain circumstances.

Married parents have the ultimate right to decide with whom their child has contact.

&nbsp;

Grandparents may ask a court for a visitation order with a grandchild if:


	
	The grandchild’s parents are or were involved in a divorce, dissolution, legal separation, annulment or child support court case.
	
	
	One or both of the natural parents die.
	
	
	The grandchild’s parents are not married. The mother’s parents may request visitation at any time. &nbsp;The father’s parents may request visitation only after paternity has been established.
	


If the father dies or disappears before paternity has been legally established, paternal grandparents will have a difficult time seeking visitation.

&nbsp;

Grandparents who are denied contact with their grandchildren may need to seek help from a professional social worker or family counselor. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How do you get the court order?

&nbsp;

A grandparent must prove that visitation will be in the child’s best interest.

&nbsp;

To obtain a visitation order, a grandparent must file a motion with the court. &nbsp;The court must determine that the grandparent has an interest in the welfare of the child. &nbsp;The court must determine that the visitation would be in the best interest of the child.

&nbsp;

A grandparent will have to testify at a hearing and present evidence to convince a judge or magistrate to make an order.

The parents have the right to present their own evidence.Parents have the right to object to an order of visitation.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What happens once a Grandparent has the court order?

&nbsp;

If the parents do not follow the order, a grandparent can enforce it through a motion for contempt.

&nbsp;

Generally, a later marriage or remarriage of a parent does not affect the order.

&nbsp;

The adoption of the child by a stranger (not a family member) or a stepparent can terminate a grandparent’s right to visitation.

&nbsp;

The laws that apply to grandparents apply to other relatives of the child and sometimes to non-relatives who have an important interest in the welfare of the child.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Where do you file?

&nbsp;

If the grandchild’s parents are, or have been &nbsp;involved in a divorce, dissolution, legal separation, annulment or child support court case, a grandparent must file a petition in the &nbsp;same court where the parents’ case is (was) &nbsp;filed.

&nbsp;

If the parents of the child are unmarried and there is no prior case, the grandparent’s petition has to be filed in the Juvenile Court in the county where the child lives.

&nbsp;

If the child lives outside of Ohio, the law of the state where the child lives will apply to grandparent visitation.

52,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/54,Parental Rights and Child Custody,Custody,,Family Law,"In Ohio, two different courts can make decisions about parental rights or child custody. Domestic Relations Court can decide parental rights as part of a divorce, legal separation or civil protection order. Juvenile Court can decide custody if the parents are not married or if no other court has made an order.

What is parental rights or custody? 


	The right to have physical care and control of a child;
	The right to decide where and with whom a child lives;
	The duty to protect, train and discipline; and
	The duty to provide food, shelter, education and medical care.


How does a court decide who should have parental rights or custody? 
There are two standards that a court must follow: one for parents and one for non-parents. If the court must decide between two parents, the court must determine the “best interest” of the child. Factors that help the court decide “best interest” are set out in the law. If the court must decide between a parent and a non-parent, the court must first find that the parent is “unfit” to have custody. Only then can the non-parent be considered as a custodian.

How does a court determine what is in the best interest of a child? 
In determining best interest of a child the court considers all relevant factors including:


	the wishes of the child’s parents;
	the wishes of the child;
	the child’s relationships with relatives;
	the mental and physical health of the parties involved;
	the child’s adjustment to home, school and community;
	failure to encourage court ordered visitation;
	failure to make child support payments;
	conviction or adjudication of child abuse or neglect or domestic violence;
	plans to relocate out-of-state


What is shared parenting? 
A Domestic Relations Court may decide to “allocate” parental rights according to a shared parenting plan. The plan is developed by either or both the parents. The Plan sets out who is the residential parent and divides between the parents the other rights and responsibilities for the care of the children including child support and companionship. The court must determine that the shared parenting plan is in the best interest of the child. In determining “best interest” the court considers all relevant factors. The court can look at:


	the ability of the parents to cooperate and make decisions jointly;
	the ability of each parent to encourage the sharing of love, affection and contact between the child and the other parent;
	any history of or potential for child abuse, parental kidnapping, spouse abuse or domestic violence;
	The geographic proximity of the parents;
	recommendation of a guardian ad litem.


How do I obtain parental rights? 
There are several ways to ask a court make a decision about parental rights/custody. In Domestic Relations Court, parental rights can be sought in a divorce complaint or after the divorce has been granted, in a motion to reallocate parental rights. In Juvenile Court, a petition for custody can be filed or, if custody has already been determined, a motion to modify the prior order can be filed. In either case, the parties can agree to the terms of the change or, in a contested case, the court can decide.

What if the parents agree to a custody change? 
Parents of a child may decide to change custody for many reasons. Loss of job or income, forced relocation, substance abuse, domestic violence or other significant life stressors may cause the need for a change of custody. Many times grandparents or other relatives can provide necessarily stable homes for a temporary period of time.

A custody change cannot be accomplished by having a statement witnessed by a notary public. A court must order the change of custody. To change custody, a complaint or motion is filed in court. All parties consent to the change of custody. This includes the parents and current legal custodian. Despite the agreement, the Court must still find that the custody change is in the best interest of the child.

Do I need an attorney to represent me? 
If you agree with the terms of a custody change you may not need an attorney to represent you. You should clearly understand what is intended:


	Who will have custody and for how long?
	What are the visitation rights?
	What is the child support order?
	Is health insurance available for the child?
	If not, who pays for medical coverage?
	What are the other needs of the child and how are these needs being met?


If you understand the arrangement and agree with it, you probably do not need an attorney.

53,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/55,Parental Visitation Fact Sheet,Visitation,,Family Law,"If the parents are married:

Courts must include a specific schedule for parenting time which insures frequent and continuing contact in a final order ending a marriage, unless the court determines that it would not be in the child’s best interest.

If the parents are not married:

A father seeking visitation must file a motion with the juvenile court [Domestic Relations Court in Summit County] seeking to establish visitation. Paternity must be established first. If paternity has not been established, fathers should contact the Child Support Enforcement Agency for assistance.

Factors to determine ‘best interest’ include:


	prior interaction of the child with parents and relatives;
	geographical location of the parent’s residences;
	available time to parent;
	the child’s age;
	the child’s adjustment to home, school and community;
	the child’s wishes;
	the health and safety of child;
	the time available for the child to spend with siblings;
	the mental and physical health of all parties;
	any willful denial of visitation by a party;
	the wishes of a parent as to visitation by a grandparent or third party;
	any prior conviction or adjudication of abuse or neglect;
	and any other factor in the best interest of the child.


Visitation Schedule 

Courts have standard orders that establish companionship or visitation schedules for parents. Usually, the schedule is every other weekend, every other holiday and summer vacation. The standard schedule differs from court to court. Courts may have schedules based on the age of the child or the distance that must be traveled. Visitation may be limited if there are risk factors to the child. Parents who are in agreement can set a different schedule that meets their needs. Parents who cannot agree or who have other concerns should use the court’s standard order.

Give the Clerk your case number and ask politely if the other party has been served.

1. If the other party has been served, you do not need to do anything more. Your hearing will be held as scheduled.

2. If the other party has not been served, ask the Clerk the reason.


	If the certified mail receipt has not been returned, check again with the Clerk in two to three weeks until you find out whether service was made.
	If the certified mail receipt was returned showing service was refused or unclaimed, you need to file the Instructions for Service again. You will need to draft new Instructions for Service like the one you used the first time. This time, mark that service is to be made by ""Regular Mail"" not by Certified Mail. You must then take this new Instruction for Service back to the Clerk, along with a copy of the time-stamped papers you have filed before. Be sure to keep a copy for your records. Refile the new Instructions for Service. Wait about a month. Call the Clerk again to make sure that the clerk did send the papers by regular mail. If this was done, that is all you need to do. The hearing will be held as scheduled. If the clerk tells you that the papers did not get sent out regular mail, ask why and how to correct the problem.
	If the certified mail receipt was returned for any other reason, such as ""Addressee Unknown"" or ""Insufficient Address,"" you will need to find out the correct or new address where the person receives mail. Refile the Instructions for Service exactly as you did before, requesting certified mail.


3. If the other party has not been served by one week before the scheduled hearing, you must call the Clerk's Office to cancel the hearing. Ask to reschedule a new date and time. Once you have the new date and time, fill out a new Notice of Hearing and a new Instruction for Service by certified mail. File these at the Clerk's Office. Repeat the above steps to be sure that you get service before the new court date.

55,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/57,Representing Yourself on a Motion for Change of Custody,Custody,,Family Law,"Filing a Motion for Change of Custody

What Do I Need to Prove? Since you filed the Motion for Change of Custody, you must prove the reasons for that request. You must convince the Judge or Magistrate that:


	circumstances have changed regarding the child or residential parent since the original custody order granting your ex-spouse custody; AND
	as a result of those changes, it is now in the best interests of the child or children that you get custody AND
	the change of environment would cause more good than harm to the child or children.


Examples of circumstances that justify a change in custody:

Your ex-spouse is:


	currently in jail or has been convicted of a crime;
	has been charged with child neglect or abuse;
	is drinking or using drugs excessively; or
	is in the hospital for some physical or mental incapacity.


Your child:


	is not doing well in school; or
	has been declared unruly or delinquent.


If you and your ex-spouse agree to the change of custody, your testimony and the testimony of your ex-spouse should be enough to get custody changed.

If you and your ex-spouse do not agree on the change of custody, you must present evidence to show that your children will be better off in your custody.

REMEMBER: If your ex-spouse cannot or will not appear in court, have him/her write a paper stating that he/she agrees to the change of custody. Get that statement notarized (sign the paper in front of a notary public who will also sign and stamp the document).

Show Up for the Hearing On Time The Court will set a time and date for a hearing on your case. The court will let you know this date immediately after you file your court papers or mail you a reminder notice. Mark this date on your calendar. If you do not show up at the hearing, the court will automatically rule in favor of your ex-spouse.

REMEMBER: If you move anytime after filing the motion to modify custody, you must notify the court of your new address. If you don’t, the Court will have no way of letting you know the time and date of the hearing.

What to Bring to Court Documents and other evidence that prove that a change of custody should occur:


	school records for the child
	certified copy of judgment entry of conviction against your spouse (proof convicted of the crime)
	certified copy of your child’s adjudication of delinquency
	Witnesses who will testify on your behalf. Only use witnesses who will testify in your favor.
	You can testify on your own behalf.
	If your children are old enough, they can also tell the court that they would rather live with you.
	Financial information, including proof of income. Bring at least one of the following:
	
		a letter from your welfare office or employer
		your paycheck stub and tax return
		letter from the Social Security Administration
	
	


TIP Ask the Judge or Magistrate to speak to the children in his or her office alone after he has heard all of the other witnesses. The Judge probably will not let either you or your ex-spouse hear what the children say.

What to Do at the Hearing 

1. The Court may ask if you want to make an opening statement.

Explain to the Judge why you believe custody should be changed and why that change would be best for your child or children. Your ex-spouse will be given a chance to summarize his/her reasons for opposing the change of custody.

2. Call your first witness. Don’t forget—you can call yourself as a witness. If you have more than one witness, you can call them in any order you want to.

If you are the witness, tell the Judge or Magistrate why you believe that custody should be changed. Include the reasons stated in your Motion. Also, explain why this change is in the best interests of your child or children. Only testify to things that you know or have seen yourself.

When someone else is the witness:


	Ask the witness to tell the court his/her name and relationship to you and/or your ex-spouse.



	Question the witness about the topics or incidents that you want him/her to talk about.


TIP When questioning witnesses:


	Keep your questions short and open-ended.
	
		For example, “Have you ever seen my ex-husband interacting with our children? Can you tell me what you saw?”
	
	
	Don’t argue with the witness. If they don’t answer as you expected, just move on.


3. If the other parent testifies or has witnesses, you will be allowed to cross examine them. Don’t do it. This is very hard to pull off. Take notes. Ask the judge to allow you or your witness to testify about what the witness said if you think it was wrong.

56,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/58,Caretaker Authorization Fact Sheet,Grandparent Custody/Visitation/Adoption Issues,,Family Law,"What is a Caretaker Authorization?&nbsp; A Caretaker Authorization Affidavit is a legal document.&nbsp; It gives a grandparent temporary authority to make decisions about a grandchild’s care.&nbsp;

A Caretaker Authorization Affidavit does not:


	Award legal custody&nbsp;
	Affect the rights of the child’s parents, guardian or custodian in any future legal proceeding;
	Give authority to a grandparent to consent to adoption or marriage of the child;
	Modify or redirect child support payments for the child.


What does a Caretaker Authorization do?&nbsp; It gives the grandparent legal authority to:


	Enroll the child in school
	Consent to school activities
	Access the child’s school information
	Be involved in the child’s educational planning
	Arrange for the child’s medical, dental and psychological treatment


Who can get a Caretaker Authorization Affidavit (CAA)?&nbsp; A grandparent may sign a CAA if;


	There is a grandchild living in the household,
	the child’s parents, guardian or custodian cannot be located or contacted.


Can any relative of the child be given a CAA?&nbsp; No, only grandparents at this time.&nbsp;

When can a CAA be created?&nbsp; It can be created only if the parents, guardian or custodian cannot be located or contacted.&nbsp; It may not be created for the sole purpose of changing schools to participate in academic or sports programs.&nbsp;

What if there is a case already pending?&nbsp; A CAA is not effective if there is:


	A proceeding to appoint a guardian or for the adoption of the child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	A divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment proceeding
	A proceeding to allocate parental rights and responsibilities
	A proceeding where the child is alleged to be dependent, neglected or abused
	The child is in shelter care or detention and no hearing has yet been held
	There is a temporary custody order for emergency medical treatment of the child.


How is a CAA created?&nbsp; A CAA form must be completed and signed in front of an Ohio notary public by the grandparent seeking it.

What are the other requirements after the CAA is created?&nbsp; It must be filed in court within the next 5 days.&nbsp; File the original CAA with the Juvenile Court in the county where the grandparent lives.&nbsp; If another court in the past has made a custody order for the child, the CAA must be filed in that court.&nbsp;

Does a grandparent always have to attempt to locate the parents?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Parents do not have to be contacted if:


	The father does not have to be located if paternity has not been established.&nbsp;
	A court order prohibits a parent from receiving a notice of change of residence of the child
	The parent’s parental rights have been terminated by a Juvenile Court order


Is there a court hearing after the CAA is filed?&nbsp; No court hearing is required.

How long is the CAA valid?&nbsp; It’s temporary.&nbsp; It ends after one year or earlier if:


	The child stops living with the grandparent
	Death of the child
	Death of the designated grandparent
	A parent, in writing, revokes or reverses a decision of the grandparent
	Termination by court order


What must I do if the CAA is terminated?&nbsp; The grandparent must send written notice within 7 days to:


	the court&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The child’s school
	The child’s health care providers
	The child’s health insurance coverage provider
	Any other person or entity that has an ongoing relationship with the child
	The Court in which it was filed


Can the CAA be renewed by the grandparent after one year?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; A new CAA must be created and filed with the Court.&nbsp; However, the Court will hold a hearing to determine whether another CAA is in the child’s best interest.

How can a grandparent with a CAA get child support?&nbsp; Grandparents must file in court or with the Child Support Enforcement Agency to modify an existing order or to seek a new order of child support.

For parents who can’t agree, a divorce court must decide the rights and responsibilities of parents.&nbsp; The law is in the Ohio Revised Code at Section 3109.04.&nbsp; Read the law for yourself if you want to know more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A court will decide parenting rights and responsibilities.&nbsp; The decision is based on the ‘best interests of a child.’ The court can order shared parenting.&nbsp; Or the court can name one parent as the sole residential parent and legal custodian.

In shared parenting, both parents have custody of the children with a parenting schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the child is school age, then one parent must be chosen as the residential parent for school purposes.

The court can name one residential parent and legal custodian.&nbsp; The other parent has rights to companionship or visitation.&nbsp;

A court must consider these factors in deciding a child’s ‘best interest’:


	each parent’s wishes;
	the child’s wishes;
	the child’s interaction with the parents, siblings, and others;
	the child’s adjustment to the home, school and community;
	the mental and physical health of all persons involved;
	the parent most likely to make visitation easier;
	whether a parent has failed to pay child support;
	whether the custodial parent has willfully denied visitation to the other parent;
	whether either parent is planning to move out of state; and
	whether either parent has abused a child or a family or household member.


The court may interview the children privately.&nbsp;&nbsp; A child’s wishes are only one of the many factors in deciding what is in the child’s ‘best interest.’&nbsp; The court must interview a child if either parent requests it.&nbsp;

The court may appoint a guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem assists the court in making a custody determination.&nbsp; The guardian ad litem or a court custody employee may investigate the child’s home and school.&nbsp; The guardian ad litem may interview teachers, parents, the child and others.&nbsp; The guardian ad litem will make a recommendation to the court as to what is in the best interest of the child. The court may also order physical or mental examinations of the parents or child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

58,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/60,Common Divorce Questions,Divorce,,Family Law,"What issues can be resolved in a divorce?

Divorce is strictly a legal process. Only legal issues can be resolved. What a divorce cannot do is punish one party or place blame.

How long will the divorce process take? 

At the beginning of a divorce, it is hard to predict how long it will take. Your attorney can better judge length after the case is underway. Some factors that affect length are:


	The number and complexity of contested issues
	The parties’ ability to work together
	The court’s calendar
	The lawyer representing the other party


The case begins when your divorce complaint is filed with the court. Your spouse has 28 days after receiving the complaint to respond by filing an “answer.” If an answer is filed, the case is contested. If no answer is filed, the case is uncontested. In contested cases, a status conference is held about four months after the complaint is filed. A pretrial conference is held two to three months after that. If an agreement can be reached, the matter may be finalized. If not, a trial is scheduled. After the trial is held, the court makes a written decision. This can take about a year.

What will the divorce cost? 

There is no charge for attorneys’ fees if you remain financially eligible and are represented by CLAS. However, there are other financial costs. Filing a case requires a deposit with the court. If you don’t have funds for the deposit, a poverty affidavit can postpone payment until your case is completed. There also may be costs to properly prepare the evidence for your final divorce hearing. There may be costs for property valuation, discovery, court reporters, transcripts, a guardian ad litem, supervised visits, or pension evaluation.

What do I do about custody, visitation, property, and other issues while the divorce is proceeding? 

There may be a hearing to decide important issues while your divorce is in process. A magistrate issues a written decision called a temporary order. The temporary order remains in effect until modified or the case ends. The temporary orders are not permanent. They may be different than the court’s final decision.

Is there an alternative to going to trial? 

One alternative is to reach a settlement agreement. If you and your spouse can decide most of the issues in the divorce, it can make the court trial shorter. Your attorney can assist you in negotiating a settlement. Do not sign anything without your lawyer present.

Is what I tell my attorney confidential? 

Yes. Confidentiality is essential for honesty and openness and is necessary for success in your divorce. Your attorney is prohibited from telling other people what you have told him or her.

May I bring someone with me to meetings with my attorney? 

Your divorce is unique. It will be different from other people’s divorces. Bringing third parties such as a friend, neighbor or another family member into your meetings with your attorney is not encouraged. Your discussions with your lawyer may not remain confidential if another person is at the meeting. If your spouse finds out, the third party can be legally required testify about what you told the lawyer.

How will our property be divided? 

By law, the property will be divided equitably. Before the property is divided it must be identified, valued, and classified as marital or separate. Some factors that the court will use in determining property distribution are the duration of the marriage, the property and debts of the spouses, the cost of sale, tax consequences, and any division made by a separate agreement.

Who will have to pay our debts? 

Debt is treated similarly to the property. Before it is allocated, it must be identified, valued, and classified. The creditor is not a party to your divorce. If both you and your spouse signed for the debt, the creditor may collect from either of you regardless of whom the court orders to pay the debt.

Will spousal support be ordered? 

There is no guarantee or right to spousal support. Unless your spouse agrees to pay you support, the judge decides whether spousal support is appropriate. The decision to award spousal support depends on the relative needs and resources of the parties. Some factors that the court will use in determining spousal support are the income of the parties, the parties earning ability, age, physical, mental, and emotional strength, retirement benefits, duration of the marriage, standard of living, education and tax consequences.

Who will get custody of my children? 

The court prefers for parents to create their own plan for custody and parenting time (visitation). If you and your spouse cannot develop a plan, the court will use a set of factors to determine what is in the best interest of the children. These factors include the wishes of the parents, the mental and physical health of all parties, whether a parent has been convicted of abuse or neglect of the child or domestic violence and the ability of the parents to get along. The question is not who is the better parent but what is in the best interest of the children. Every judge sees the standard “best interest of the child” differently.

How do courts decide parenting time?

The best parenting time (visitation) schedule is your own plan. However, if you and your spouse cannot agree, most courts have a standard schedule. If there are objections to this schedule because of special circumstances (travel time, work schedules), or problems (substance abuse, mental illness, violence), you may present specific facts in a scheduled hearing stating why this parenting time is not in the best interest of your child.

How much child support will be ordered?

The court will make an order of support for the children based on a formula provided by law. The formula includes factors such as the gross income of the parents, the cost of healthcare and childcare, and the number of children.

Do I have to keep my husband’s name after the divorce? 

The law allows you to decide to keep your married name or to change it to any name you had before.

How should I file my tax return? 

Beware of signing a joint tax return. When you sign a joint tax return, you become jointly responsible for any errors or inaccuracies on the return and for outstanding liability. Consult your attorney about how you should file your taxes while in the divorce process.

Will dating while my divorce is pending affect the outcome? 

Dating while your divorce is pending may create problems for you. If custody is at issue, evidence of your dating or involving a third person with your children is bad for your case and may result in the loss of custody. Dating is not recommended. However, if you do decide to date, you must fully inform your attorney about your decision and the people you are dating. Your attorney will discuss with you the possible consequences of your actions.

Divorce",,Family Law,"Glossary of Terms

&nbsp;

Custody (Allocation of Parental Rights):&nbsp;Custody is the legal right and responsibility awarded by a court for the possession and care of a child. Legal custody refers to decision-making responsibility. Physical custody relates to where the child will live or physical access to the child.

Shared parenting:&nbsp;Shared parenting can mean equal joint custody of a child or any other reasonable agreement the parents make. The court will decide if a Shared Parenting Plan is in the best interest of a child. A Shared Parenting Plan can be written so that the child sees one parent 85% of the time and the other 15%. It could also be that the child spends the school year with one parent and the summer with the other. The Court may still order child support payments with a Shared Parenting Plan. A court will not order Shared Parenting unless the parties agree. Don’t agree to Shared Parenting before talking with your attorney.

&nbsp;

Guardian ad litem (GAL):&nbsp;A GAL is usually a lawyer appointed by the court to represent the best interest of the child. The best interest of the child may be different than what the child wants. The GAL is not the child’s attorney.

&nbsp;

Discovery:&nbsp;Discovery is a process of finding out information about your spouse, your spouse’s assets and what your spouse wants. Informal discovery is done without a formal request. This can include getting copies of bank statements or titles from your home. Formal discovery has rules and is done through interrogatories, document requests or depositions. Your spouse may use discovery to require you to produce information about you or your assets.

Status conference:&nbsp;A status conference is scheduled after your divorce complaint is filed. The purpose of this conference is for the lawyers and court magistrate to review case progress. You may be required to attend the status conference. Your attorney will advise you.

&nbsp;

Pre-trial conference:&nbsp;A pre-trial conference is usually the first meeting with the lawyers and the judge. It’s scheduled after the last status conference. The lawyers are required to submit a pre-trial statement with information about the marriage, asset values, debts and contested issues. A final trial date is set at this conference.

&nbsp;

Order:&nbsp;The court’s ruling on a motion. It can require the parties to do certain things or set out rights and responsibilities. An order is in writing, signed by the judge and filed with the court.

&nbsp;

Temporary orders:&nbsp;The Court may issue temporary orders for parental rights, child support, maintenance of insurance or other important issues. These temporary orders remain in effect only until your divorce is final. Final orders may be different than temporary orders.

Tax Issues


	If you receive child support, it is not taxable. If you pay child support, it is not deductible.
	In general, spousal support is taxed to the person who receives it and deductible to the person who pays it because it is considered income. However, this is not always a simple issues and may only apply if certain requirements are met.


Debt allocation If a creditor tries to get you to pay a debt that your ex-spouse was ordered to pay, or if your ex-spouse is simply not paying on a debt he or she was ordered to pay, you may file a Motion for Contempt in the Domestic Relations Court that granted your divorce.

Bankruptcy If your ex-spouse files for bankruptcy, he or she may be protected from his creditor’s collection efforts. If the debt belonged to both you and your ex-spouse, regardless of the Domestic Relations Court order, the creditor can continue to collect the debt from you. Remember: Creditor’s do not have to honor the terms of your divorce order.

CLAS agreed to represent you for your divorce and only your divorce. After your divorce is finalized you will need to call and reapply with CLAS for any post decree motions. There is no guarantee that your case will be accepted.

62,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/64,Termination of Marriage and Legal Separation in Ohio,Divorce/Separation/Annulment,,Family Law,"There are three ways to terminate a marriage in the State of Ohio. These&nbsp;include annulment, dissolution and divorce.

Annulment

An annulment means that a marriage is declared a legal nullity. The granting of an annulment voids the marriage.

You may obtain an annulment for the following reasons:


	An underage spouse (age 18 for males and age 16 for females with parental consent)
	Prior valid marriage with surviving spouse (bigamy)
	Mental incompetence of one party
	Consent to marry obtained by fraud or force (coercion);
	Failure to consummate the marriage


The time period for seeking an annulment varies depending on the reason for the annulment. An action can be brought within the time prior to reaching the legal age to marry, the life of the former spouse or incompetent party or within two years after the marriage or discovery of the fraud.

Dissolution

A dissolution of marriage terminates the marital relationship by agreement of the parties. A dissolution action is initiated by the filing of a petition for dissolution with a separation agreement attached.

In order to obtain a dissolution of marriage, the husband and wife must agree on both the termination of the marriage and all of the terms and conditions of the separation agreement.

A separation agreement must provide for a division of all property; spousal support (alimony) where allowed; and all matters related to minor children of the marriage, including custody, visitation and support. It must be signed by both spouses and is a binding and valid contract. The husband and wife must be living separate and apart at the time of the signing of the separation agreement.

The Court must approve the terms of the separation agreement before a decree of dissolution can be granted. A hearing will be held sometime between 10 and 90 days after the petition if filed. For the case to proceed, both spouses must appear at this hearing. For the Court to approve the separation agreement, both husband and wife must state under oath that he/she agrees to the dissolution of the marriage and that he/she is satisfied with terms of the separation agreement.

If one spouse advises the Court that he/she does not want the marriage to be terminated or that he/she is dissatisfied with the separation agreement, the Court cannot grant the dissolution. If this happens, one spouse can file a motion asking the matter be converted to the divorce action.

If the Court grants the dissolution of marriage, the terms of the separation agreement become an enforceable court order.

Divorce

A divorce action is a contested proceeding that is initiated by the filing of a complaint alleging reasons or grounds for termination of the marriage. The other spouse can file a counterclaim alleging his/her own grounds for divorce.

Ohio does not provide for a ""no-fault"" divorce. Any party seeking a divorce must establish grounds for the divorce. Some the grounds or reasons are bigamy; adultery; habitual drunkenness; and imprisonment in a state or federal correctional facility at the time of the filing of the complaint. However, the most commonly alleged grounds for divorce are gross neglect of duty; extreme cruelty; lived separate and apart without cohabitation without interruption for one year, and incompatibility.

Generally, you will need at least one corroborating witness at the divorce hearing to confirm or support your testimony regarding the grounds for divorce. (For example, a corroborating witness can testify that they know that you and your spouse have lived separate and apart for one year.)

The issues that will be considered by the Court in a divorce action can be numerous and will vary from case to case. Usually, the Court will address the following issues:


	Grounds for termination of the marriage
	Division of marital assets (real and personal property including bank accounts, pensions and retirement accounts)
	Custody, visitation and support of any minor children born as issue of the marriage and/or adopted by the parties
	Spousal support (alimony)
	Division of liabilities (determination of responsibility for marital debts)


Restoration of Name

At the time of termination of the marriage, a spouse may be restored to any name that the person had before the marriage.

Legal Separation

A legal separation is a court order where the husband and wife remain married but live separately.

A legal separation is a civil court order that does not legally end a marriage, but allows the court to issue orders concerning division of property, spousal support (alimony), and visitation and custody for any minor children. The parties remain married but live separately.

A legal separation is not required to live separate and apart from your spouse. However, a legal separation creates an enforceable court order setting forth the rights and obligations of each spouse, such as spousal support (alimony) or child support.

Residency Requirement

The spouse filing the complaint (annulment, divorce or legal separation) and at least one petitioner/spouse (dissolution) must be:


	A resident of the State of Ohio for at least 6 months immediately prior to the filing of the complaint or petition; and
	A resident of the county for at least 90 days immediately prior to the filing of the complaint or petition.


Note: There are some exceptions to the residency requirement in cases involving domestic violence.

If there is domestic violence in the marital relationship, a Civil Protection Order (CPO) may be helpful prior to the filing of the annulment, dissolution, legal separation, or divorce. The police will be able to provide more assistance to the abused if a CPO is in force.

It is recommended that you obtain the advice of an attorney. You may obtain an attorney referral from your local bar association. If you cannot afford an attorney, you may contact our Legal Aid HelpLine.

64,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/66,Dividing Marital Property in a Divorce,Divorce,,Family Law,"A divorce court must divide the property of spouses according to law. &nbsp;The law is in the Ohio Revised Code at Section 3105.171. &nbsp;Read the law for yourself if you want to know more.

&nbsp;

The court decides what property is the separate property of one spouse and what property is marital property.


	
	Marital property is property owned by either or both the spouses.
	
	
	The property is usually acquired during the marriage.

	
		
		The court decides what during the marriage means.
		
		
		The court may look to the length of the relationship:

		
			
			whether the parties lived together before marrying;
			
			
			whether they separated long before they filed for divorce.
			
		
		
	
	
	
	Marital property can include an increase in the value of separate property.
	
	
	Property is not ‘separate property’ solely because only one spouse’s name is on a title or deed. &nbsp;For example, the court may find that a house, even though it was purchased before the marriage, is owned by both spouses.
	
	
	Separate property can include:

	
		
		An inheritance by one spouse
		
		
		Real or personal property acquired by one spouse before the marriage
		
		
		A gift to only one spouse
		
	
	


Again, the court decides what is separate and what is marital property.

&nbsp;

The court must divide marital property equally unless that would be unfair. &nbsp;The court must look at certain factors. &nbsp;The law assumes spouses contributed equally to obtaining marital assets. &nbsp;This is true even if one party was a stay at home homemaker. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

The court must divide marital property before it can decide if spousal support is needed by either party. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

The court may award title to specific property or may order payments over time. &nbsp;The court can decide which spouse is awarded what property so that the division is fair. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

The court cannot later modify a division of marital property. &nbsp;Even if circumstances change, the parties cannot later ask the court for a larger share of the marital property. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

An award of spousal support or marital property cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.

66,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/68,Guardianship,Family Law,,Family Law,"What is a Guardian, Ward and a Guardianship?

&nbsp;

A guardian is a person or entity appointed by probate court. A guardian acts on behalf of an incompetent person or a minor, called a ward. A guardian can oversee legal and financial matters or the personal care of a ward or both. The relationship between the guardian and ward is a guardianship. Family members often are appointed as guardians. An agency or bank may be appointed as guardian of the estate if no family member is able to step in.

&nbsp;

Probate court decides if a guardian is necessary. The court decides what powers the guardian should have to protect to the ward. Probate court will determine if a person cannot handle their own affairs. Guardians are appointed only for incompetent persons or for minors.

&nbsp;

An incompetent person is mentally impaired as the result of a physical or mental illness, disability or chronic substance abuse. And either:


	
	is incapable of caring for himself or his property; or
	
	
	fails to provide for his family or other persons as required by law.
	


Any person confined to a correctional institution in Ohio is also considered an incompetent.

&nbsp;

A competent adult whose physical health is failing can request another type of a guardian called a conservator. The adult can grant specific powers to a conservator to help with personal care or financial management. This is a voluntary matter. Probate court must decide if the conservator is suitable.

&nbsp;

Types of Guardianships

&nbsp;

A guardian of the person is responsible for the day to day needs of the ward. This includes providing food, shelter, clothing, health care and necessities.

&nbsp;

A guardian of the estate manages the property and financial affairs of the ward. This includes paying debts, investing assets and managing property of the ward.

&nbsp;

A guardian appointed with specific limited powers is a limited guardian. The ward keeps all rights that have not been granted to the guardian by the probate court.

&nbsp;

An interim guardian can be appointed by probate court if a guardian is removed or resigns.

&nbsp;

Probate Court can appoint an emergency guardian if immediate action is required to prevent significant injury to the person or estate of a minor or incompetent. An emergency guardianship lasts only three days.

&nbsp;

Appointment of a Guardian

&nbsp;

A person or the court can begin a guardianship proceeding. The prospective ward has certain rights:


	
	to have an independent attorney of his choice;
	
	
	to have a friend or family member of his choice present at the hearing;
	
	
	to have an independent expert evaluation;
	
	
	if the ward has low income, to have the attorney and expert evaluator appointed at court expense.
	


A probate court investigator will make a recommendation to the court. The burden of proving incompetence is by clear and convincing evidence.

&nbsp;

Alternatively, a person can name another person to be his/her guardian in a durable power of attorney or similar document.

&nbsp;

Bond Requirement

&nbsp;

Usually, a person seeking to be guardian must file a bond in probate court. The bond is like insurance to protect the ward’s property. The bond protects the property from unlawful action by the guardian. The amount of the bond is fixed by the court. The bond can be waived, depending on the ward’s assets.

&nbsp;

Powers and Duties of a Guardian

&nbsp;

Probate court sets the powers and duties of guardians under law. Guardians must act in the best interest of the ward. Guardians must seek approval from probate court for certain actions. Probate court is called the ‘superior guardian’.

&nbsp;

Duty to File Reports and Accounts

&nbsp;

Every two years the guardian of an incompetent person must file a report with the probate court giving specific information about the ward and the guardianship. The court must determine that the guardian is acting in the ward’s best interest and that there is a need for the guardianship to continue.

&nbsp;

An account must be filed by a guardian of the estate or conservator every two years. The account shows all receipts and disbursements by the guardian. It includes a statement of all of the ward’s property held by the guardian.

&nbsp;

Termination of the Guardianship

&nbsp;

Probate court can end a guardianship if it is no longer needed. Probate court can set a hearing to take evidence about changes to the ward’s physical and mental condition. The guardianship of a minor ends when the ward turns 18 years old. The marriage of a minor ends the guardianship over the person but not over the property.

67,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/69,Name Change Fact Sheet,Family Law,,Family Law,"Generally, probate court has jurisdiction to change names of both adults and minors. If a minor is the ward of juvenile court, that court has jurisdiction to change the child’s name. This usually occurs in a paternity action.

&nbsp;

Adult Name Change 

Under common law, an adult may change his or her name at will. No legal proceedings are required. The adult merely adopts another name. It must be done in good faith and with no intent to deceive. This is a called an alias. However, to change any public record, such as a driver’s license, a name change must be completed according to law.

The applicant will need to file an ‘Application to Change Name’ in the Probate Court of the county in which he or she has lived for at least one year. A notice of the request of name change must be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 30 days prior to the hearing. The applicant must have “reasonable and proper cause” for the name change. The court has the authority to inquire as to motives.

&nbsp;

Name Change of a Child

A parent of a child seeking a name change must have the consent of the other parent if living. A non-consenting parent has the right to have notice and a hearing on the matter. The court may change the child’s name without parental consent where the name change would be in the child’s best interest.

The applicant will need to file an ‘Application to Change Name of Minor’ in the probate court of the county in which he or she and the minor child have lived for at least one year. A notice of the request of name change must be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 30 days prior to the hearing.

The probate or juvenile court is required by law to consider the following:


	
	Effect of change on preservation and development of child’s relationship with each parent;
	
	
	Identification of the child as part of the family unit;
	
	
	The length of time child has used surname;
	
	
	The preference of the child if of sufficient maturity to express meaningful preference;
	
	
	Whether child’s surname is different from the surname of child’s residential parent;
	
	
	Embarrassment, discomfort and inconvenience that may result when child bears different surname from the residential parent;
	
	
	Parental failure to maintain contact and support;
	
	
	And any other factor in child’s best interest.
	


A child’s surname also can be changed as a result of paternity being established.

68,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/70,Paternity,Paternity,,Family Law,"When is establishing paternity necessary?

&nbsp;

Courts cannot order child support for children born to parents who are not married until paternity is determined. A parent who receives OWF will be required to seek paternity establishment. The Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) can assist in establishing paternity. The Agency does not offer paternity services if:


	
	there is a presumption that the man and the child’s mother are or have been married to each other, and
	
	
	the child is born during the marriage or his born within three hundred days after the marriage is terminated.
	


Can paternity be established at the hospital?

If you are currently pregnant and unmarried, you can contact the social worker at your hospital for more information about paternity establishment at the hospital. The father will need to agree to complete an Acknowledgment of Paternity Affidavit.

&nbsp;

How do I request paternity establishment?

If you are receiving Ohio Works First (OWF) benefits, the County Department of Jobs and Family Services (DJFS) will automatically refer your case to CSEA. If you are not receiving OWF benefits, call CSEA to set an appointment for paternity establishment. After you complete an intake interview and are enrolled for services, CSEA must determine that paternity needs to be established. If so, you will receive a Notice and Order to Appear for genetic testing.

&nbsp;

Can paternity be established at the genetic testing conference?

Yes. The mother and the alleged father may both agree to sign an Acknowledgment of Paternity Affidavit. Each parent then has 60 days to reconsider and file a notice to rescind the acknowledgment. If no written objections are received, paternity becomes final. If the parties elect to establish paternity, the parents can also change the child’s name.

&nbsp;

What happens if either party refuses to sign the Paternity Acknowledgement Affidavit?

Genetic testing is ordered. Tissue samples (a swab used inside the mouth) are taken from the mother, the alleged father and the child. These samples are then sent to a lab where the DNA material is analyzed. If the genetic tests show a 99% or greater probability that the male is the biological father of the child, the CSEA hearing officer will forward the results to the Court for an order establishing paternity. The CSEA will send the genetic test results to you by mail.

&nbsp;

If I am ordered to undergo genetic testing, who pays for the test?

Genetic testing is paid for by the State of Ohio. The Court may require one of the parties to reimburse the State for the costs of the tests.

&nbsp;

How long must I wait before finding out the results of the genetic tests?

Genetic test results are usually available within six weeks.

&nbsp;

Do I have to attend a hearing or appear in court after the Administrative Paternity Order becomes final?

When the order becomes final, the issue of paternity is resolved and there are no further hearings on that. However, there may be a hearing on child support.

&nbsp;

I am receiving public assistance. Is it important to attend the administrative paternity conference?

You are required to appear. Failure to participate in the paternity process could result in a sanction. Your OWF benefits could be reduced or lost for a period of time.

&nbsp;

What if the parties don't appear for the Administrative Paternity Hearing?

If either of the parties fails to appear, the administrative paternity procedure is ended. The CSEA legal department will seek to establish paternity in Juvenile Court.

&nbsp;

Do I have the right to appointed counsel?

Yes, if you are unable to afford legal representation, you have the right to request appointed counsel to represent you during the paternity proceedings.

&nbsp;

What happens at the pre-trial?

Either party may request DNA testing. The alleged father may stipulate to paternity. The court will set a hearing. Visitation may be established if the parties agree or the parties can request a hearing on visitation. The court may set another hearing to determine child support. The parties may be ordered to submit financial information to CSEA to determine of child support.

&nbsp;

What if the alleged father fails to appear at the pre-trial?

If the alleged father was served with a copy of the paternity complaint, the matter will be continued. The CSEA will file a Motion for Default Judgment. The Court will schedule a hearing.

&nbsp;

Do I have to attend the hearing on the Motion for Default?

Yes. If you are the mother, you will be required to testify as to the conception, birth and paternity of your child. If you are the alleged father, you could lose valuable rights if you fail to appear.

&nbsp;

What will happen at the hearing on the Motion for Default Judgement?


	
	The alleged father may stipulate to paternity or request DNA tests if the tests have not been conducted.
	
	
	If the alleged father is not present, the mother will testify as to the conception, birth and paternity of the child.
	
	
	The Court will either order a DNA test or rule whether the alleged father is the father of the child.
	
	
	If the alleged father is the father of the child, the Court may set another hearing to determine the issue of child support.

Safety When Preparing to Leave


	
	Determine who will let you stay with them or lend you some money.

70,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/73,Now you have your CPO,Orders of Protection,,Family Law,"CLAS agreed to represent you for your CPO only. You will need to reapply for additional services. You will not be guaranteed representation.

Now that you have your CPO you should:


	
	Review the order. Make sure names are spelled correctly
	
	
	Make several copies of the CPO
	
	
	Keep a copy with you at all times
	
	
	Leave copies of the order at your workplace, home, child’s school or daycare, in your car, with a neighbor or relative
	
	
	Give a copy to anyone named in and protected by the order
	
	
	Give copies to your local police and sheriff’s department
	


Frequently Asked Questions:

What do I do if my abuser violates the CPO? Call the police to report the violation. Be sure to follow up with the police and make sure that a report was filed.

How do I prove a violation? Evidence: witnesses, medical reports, police reports, dated pictures.

How do I renew the CPO? Start the renewal process before your current CPO runs out. Avoid being unprotected or having to start the entire process over again. To renew or extend your CPO you will go to court for a short hearing. At the hearing you will need to explain why you are still in fear and need an extension of your CPO.

Courts can renew CPOs beyond their five year maximum. You must file a motion for renewal or extension of the CPO. You will also need to serve the abuser with a copy of the motion. Some courts require a new act or threat of violence before they will grant an extension or renewal. In other courts a continued fear of the abuser or a combination of past acts of violence and continued fear will be enough to extend or renew. It’s best to start the renewal process before the current CPO expires.

Do I need to give the schools a copy? Yes. It is a good idea to give schools that you or your children attend a copy of your CPO.

What happens if I move? A CPO obtained in Ohio is effective throughout Ohio. If you move you should give a copy of your CPO to your new local police or sheriff’s department. If you move outside of Ohio, you will need to check to see how your new state treats out of state orders. Federal Law allows for CPOs to follow you wherever you go through Full Faith and Credit, but different states have different laws. You can call the National Center on Full Faith and Credit to find out how your new state treats your CPO at 1-800-256-5883 ext. 2. Or call you local legal aid office.

Can a CPO be changed or modified? Yes. You can go back to court to have your CPO modified or revoked at any time. CLAS does not provide representation for revocation or modification services. Do not cause your abuser to violate your CPO. The only way to modify or terminate a CPO is in Court. You cannot “waive” a CPO by inviting the person into your home.

Do the police have to enforce the CPO? Yes. Violation of a CPO is a crime.

How do I get a new Social Security number? Contact the Social Security Administration.

Is my child eligible for benefits?

If you receive social security disability benefits, your child may be eligible to received benefits also. &nbsp;Eligibility for dependent benefits is based on the type of disability benefit you receive.

&nbsp;

What is the difference between SSI and SSD?

There are two types of disability benefits. &nbsp;To receive Disability Benefits (SSD), you must have a sufficient work history. &nbsp;If do not have a sufficient work history and you have little income and assets, you may be receiving SSI. &nbsp;It makes a difference for your children.

&nbsp;

I receive SSD. Can my child receive benefits?

With SSD benefits, dependent children are entitled to an additional benefit based on your disability. &nbsp;If your child is not receiving a dependent benefit you should apply for your child immediately.

&nbsp;

I receive SSI. &nbsp;Can my child receive benefits?

If you are receiving SSI, no dependent benefits are available.

&nbsp;

I’m disabled. &nbsp;Do I still have to pay child support?

There’s not one simple answer. &nbsp;If you are disabled and receiving SSI or SSD, the Social Security Administration has determined, based on your medical evaluation and other factors, that you are unable to work.

&nbsp;

If you are receiving SSD, your child is eligible to receive benefits based on your disability. &nbsp;You should not have to pay child support in addition to the dependent benefits your child receives. &nbsp;If you are paying child support, you should immediately

request a court hearing to end your current child support obligation.

&nbsp;

If you are receiving SSI, you do not have the countable gross income needed to calculate child support. &nbsp;By law, Ohio Revised Code Sec. 3119.01, “gross income” does not include benefits received from any means-tested, government-administered programs. &nbsp;Such programs include SSI, food stamps, Disability Financial Assistance and means-tested veteran’s benefits. &nbsp;You do not have “potential income” due to your physical or mental disabilities.

&nbsp;

In addition, the amount of your SSI benefit is barely adequate to support you. &nbsp;The SSI payment standard is below the Federal poverty guidelines.

&nbsp;

For these reasons, you should be paying no or only a minimal amount of child support. &nbsp;If you are paying child support, you should request a court hearing to end or suspend your current child support obligation.

&nbsp;

What is a minimum support order?

Whenever a court issues a child support order, the law requires that the order be set at a minimum of at least $50.00 per month. &nbsp;The court may in appropriate circumstances issue a child support order for less than $50 per month. &nbsp;The court may issue an order that the obligor has to pay no support.

&nbsp;

If you are physically or mentally disabled, the court may require you to pay the minimum or no support. &nbsp;However, even if the minimum support is ordered, the collection of the support is suspended as long as you are disabled.

&nbsp;

Uncollected support accrues as arrears. &nbsp;That means that if you become able to work again or you hit the lottery, you will have to pay the back child support at that time.

&nbsp;

Can the CSEA terminate or suspend my child support obligation if I am disabled?

Generally, the Child Support Enforcement Agency is required to strictly follow the child support worksheet and guidelines. &nbsp;Only a court can deviate from the guidelines. &nbsp;If you want to end or suspend your child support obligation, you will have to file a motion to the court that issued your child support order.

&nbsp;
"
72,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/75,Child Support Fact Sheet,Child Support,,Family Law,"A child support order is based on a child support worksheet and the ‘Basic Child Support Schedule.’ The court may decide not to follow these guidelines based on certain factors including:


	
	special needs of the child,
	
	
	other court-ordered payments,
	
	
	extended parenting time,
	
	
	significant in-kind contributions; and
	
	
	other relevant factors.
	


The calculation of child support is based on the combined gross income of both parents.

Gross Income does NOT include:


	
	Means-tested government benefits such as OWF, DFA, SSI or veterans disability and other assistance based on low income or assets;
	
	
	food stamps;
	
	
	adoption assistance or foster care maintenance.
	


Able-bodied, unemployed persons may be found to have ‘potential income.’ That can happen if they are voluntarily unemployed or underemployed. The court decides the amount of potential income. It can be based on prior employment, education, physical or mental disabilities, earning ability and other factors.

&nbsp;

The court must issue at least a minimum child support order of $50 per month. However, the court can order less or no payment based in certain circumstances. Such circumstances include the nonresidential parent’s medically verified physical or mental disability. It can include other appropriate circumstances.

&nbsp;

Either parent can seek to modify a child support amount. There must be a substantial change in circumstances. A ‘substantial change’ causes more than a ten percent change in the correct amount of child support. Also, substantial change can be that the current support order is unjust or inappropriate and not in the best interest of children.

&nbsp;

Either a court or the Child Support Enforcement agency (CSEA) can modify a child support order. The CSEA must use the child support guidelines. Only a court can decide to make an order different from the child support guidelines.

&nbsp;

A residential parent cannot modify a court order. Agreements between the parties must be in a court order to be enforced. A motion to modify child support must be filed with the court. A change in child support is not automatic.

&nbsp;

The Department of Job and Family Services (DJFS) requires anyone who receives OWF to assign their right to child support to the Department. The person receiving support cannot agree to reduce or waive current child support arrears.

&nbsp;

If past due child support is collected, it is to be sent to the person owed support, usually the custodian, unless the right to support has assigned to DJFS.

&nbsp;

For example: assume the person owed support is the custodian. DJFS claims past due support. The funds are to be paid as follows:


	
	current support is paid to the person owed support;
	
	
	any past due support from a time period after the household stopped receiving public assistance is paid to the custodian;
	
	
	any past due support from a time period before the household started receiving public assistance is paid to custodian;
	
	
	any past due support owed to DJFS is paid to DJFS from remaining funds if any.
	


If the person paying support is receiving social security benefits based on a wage record, the minor child is entitled to dependent benefits as well. Many courts will modify the child support order to reflect a credit for the amount of the dependent benefit. No dependent benefits are available with SSI.

&nbsp;

The CSEA has a number of options to enforce payment of child support. The CSEA can withhold income or assets; require a cash bond if a work situation makes withholding impractical; issue a seek work order; withhold from unemployment compensation, prisoner earnings and other payments; and deduct from accounts at financial institutions. CSEA has additional enforcement options to collect past due support. CSEA can seek payment by doing the following: execute on a certified pay-off statement; restrict access to a financial account; refusal, non-renewal or suspension of occupational or professional license; non-renewal or suspension of driver’s license; lien on real estate or personal property; collection from federal and state income tax refunds; notify consumer reporting agencies; and publication of photo and information on a poster.

&nbsp;

The CSEA can send a notice to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) seeking to suspend driving privileges after:


	
	A court or CSEA makes a final determination that there is a default; or
	
	
	The person paying support fails, after receiving notice, to comply with a subpoena or warrant from the court or CSEA.
	


The BMV cannot hold a hearing on this issue. The BMV may remove the disqualification if it receives notice from the CSEA. The CSEA may send a notice to BMV to remove the disqualification if the obligor makes full payment; that an appropriate withholding order has been issued and the obligor is complying, or a new or modified child support order has been issued and he obligor is complying.

&nbsp;

The CSEA or person owed support may file in court to enforce the order. Either may seek a finding of contempt of court. If so, the person paying support may the right to an appointed lawyer. The court will decide if the person is financially unable to afford to obtain a lawyer. Contact the court to request an appointment.

73,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/76,The National Medical Support Notice,Child Support,,Family Law,"When child support is ordered, the court may order health insurance coverage for the children. The court will order coverage if is available at a reasonable cost. The law requires employers to take action after receiving a national medical support notice.

&nbsp;

What is the National Medical Support Notice?

This notice helps children of employees obtain health insurance.

&nbsp;

How is the notice used?

The Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) sends the notice to the employer of a person who is required to provide medical insurance. The CSEA sends the notice whenever that person gets a new job. The employer must send the notice to the health plan administrator within a month. (No action is required if the employer does not provide insurance.)

Usually, the health plan administrator will enroll the children within a month after receiving the notice. There are two exceptions. There may be a waiting period. There may be more than one option for health insurance. Enrollment takes place when the waiting period ends or the plan option is selected.

The employer is required to enroll the children in any medical insurance it has available. The employer withholds the premiums from the employee’s paycheck.

Employers must determine if the payroll deductions are too much. The employer adds the amount of the child support order plus the amount of the medical insurance premium. If it will be more than they can withhold by law, the employer cannot enroll the child in the medical insurance plan.

&nbsp;

How does the residential parent learn about the insurance?

Usually, there is only one health plan available. If so, the health plan administrator will notify the residential parent about the insurance details. The administrator will furnish a description of the plan’s coverage, start date, necessary forms and information about submitting claims.

If more than one health plan is available, the administrator will give the CSEA descriptions of all the options. This includes any limits on coverage or service area. The CSEA will provide the information to the residential parent. The residential parent must choose a plan and notify the CSEA promptly. Otherwise, the children could be automatically enrolled in a default option. Or the CSEA may choose the plan.

87,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/93,Grandparent Visitation: The Law,"Grandparent Custody/Visitation/Adoption Issues
Visitation",,Family Law,"A court can grant companionship or visitation rights to a non-parent in limited circumstances. The court can grant reasonable visitation to a grandparent, relative or other person. In this fact sheet the person is referred to as ‘grandparent’.

A Divorce Court can grant visitation to a grandparent if the parents file for divorce, dissolution, legal separation, annulment or child support. A grandparent can file a motion during the court case or any time after a final order is issued.

The motion must be filed in Juvenile Court if the parents of the child are not married. The mother’s parents may file at any time. The parents of the father cannot file until paternity has been established.

Either court can grant the visitation if it determines:


	a grandparent has filed a motion seeking visitation; and
	the grandparent has an interest in the child’s welfare; and
	visitation is in the child’s best interest.


The court may interview the child in chambers. No parent or grandparent should seek a statement from the child.

The court will decide whether to grant visitation based on these factors:


	The child’s prior interaction and relationships with parents, siblings and other relatives;
	The location of the grandparent’s home and the distance to the child’s home;
	The time the child and parents have available. This includes employment, school, holiday and vacation schedules;
	The child’s age;
	The child’s adjustment to home, school, and community;
	The child’s wishes and concerns;
	The child’s health and safety;
	The amount of time available for the child to spend with siblings;
	The mental and physical health of all parties;
	The willingness of the parents and grandparents to reschedule missed visitation;
	Whether a grandparent has abused or neglected a child;
	Whether a grandparent has committed domestic violence to a household member.
	Whether either parent plans to move outside Ohio;
	The wishes and concerns of the child’s parents;
	Any other factor in the best interest of the child.


The remarriage of a residential parent does not prevent a court from granting reasonable companionship or visitation rights.

What do I have to do to get a CPO?

Obtaining a CPO is a two-step process.

First, the Petitioner/ victim fills out a written petition. Then he or she testifies under oath. If the Judge or Magistrate determines that the individual is a victim of domestic, a temporary (ex parte) CPO is issued and the Court schedules a second hearing, usually within 7 to 10 days. The Respondent/ alleged abuser is then served a copy of this order and informed of the date of the second hearing.

At the second or full hearing, both parties are entitled to be represented by a lawyer. Both parties may testify under oath and present other witnesses and evidence. After hearing all of the evidence, the Court will issue a decision granting, or denying the petition. If the petition is granted, the CPO will include a series of orders. A CPO may last for up to five years.

89,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/96,Modifying Child Support Orders,Child Support,,Family Law,"Modifying Child Support Orders: How To Increase, Decrease, or End Child Support

Where do I file to modify my child support order?

File a Motion to Modify Child Support in court


	with the Divorce Court that issued your divorce, legal separation, dissolution or CPO; or
	with the Juvenile Court that issued your custody or paternity order; or


Request the Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) to modify your prior order.

Why go to the Court?

You can apply to the Court at any time. You may not be able to get CSEA to help you except under certain circumstances. Only a court can deviate from the child support guidelines. If your case is simple and the other parent does not object, the Court may rule faster than the CSEA.

Why go to the CSEA?

You do not need a lawyer. You do not have to pay a fee.

What do I have to prove to get a child support order changed?

If your request is to the Court, you must prove:


	a significant change in circumstances (change in child’s needs or parent’s income or earning ability) since the last order was issued; and
	that this change will result in at least a 10% change in the child support order, either a reduction or an increase. Show the amount of the reduction by completing a child support worksheet. Some courts will prepare this for you.


Examples of change of circumstances you could argue to the Court: you lost your job; your work hours were cut; you got a new job but are making less money; the custodial parent got an increase in income since the last order; you now have another child for whom you are paying child support or another dependent; or your child has become ill or disabled;

If your request is to the Child Support Enforcement Agency:


	If your support order is over 3 years old: you can ask for a change for any reason.
	If your support order is less than 3 years old: you must prove one of the following specific reasons:
	Either party has experienced a 30% change in income for at least six months, due to factors outside of their control.
	Either party has been off work for the last 30 days due to factors outside of their control.
	Either party was under-employed (worked below their skill level) or unemployed at the time the last order was set and now is employed full time.
	You began receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI).
	You become permanently disabled and can provide medical proof of your disability.
	You are in jail or in an institution and have no assets to pay support.
	Health insurance costs for your children have changed so much that it would result in a 10% change in your child support obligation.
	The child for whom support is ordered is no longer eligible for support.
	You are a member of the armed services and have been called to active duty for a period of more than 30 days.
	The person paying you support has returned from active duty and is back to work.


What happens after you file a motion with the Court?

A copy of the motion will be sent to the opposing party. This is called ""Service"". You must call the Clerk of Courts periodically to ensure service is completed. If you do not know where the opposing party lives, call the CSEA for help. Once service is completed, a hearing date will be set. You must attend the hearing and prove to the judge that a ""change in circumstances"" has occurred. Bring whatever you need to prove your case with you to Court.

Always bring the following financial information:


	copies of your checks, pay stubs, or income tax returns;
	documents proving any benefit you receive such as an award letter or check stub


What if you disagree with the CSEA ruling or court decision?

If your case was decided in court by a magistrate, you can file objections to the magistrate's decision. The judge will review your case.

If your case was decided by the CSEA:


	If the CSEA ruling modifies an original CSEA order, appeal in Juvenile Court.
	If the CSEA ruling modifies a Juvenile or Domestic Relations order:
	you can request an administrative CSEA hearing.
	If you still disagree, you can appeal to the Court that issued the original order.


CAUTION! Keep paying support at the old amount until the order is changed.

How to determine the amount of child support owed.

A court orders child support based on child support guidelines and a worksheet. The Court will automatically order child support in the amount calculated by this worksheet unless one or both of the parents show that this amount is unjust or inappropriate and not in the best interest of the child.

When does my duty to pay child support end?

The law states that when one of the following events occurs, parents no longer have to pay child support:


	Your child turns 18 years old and is no longer in high school.
	Your child turns 19 years old (if they were still finishing high school at age 18)
	Your child lives on his/her own, joined the military or married (even if not yet 18).
	Your child no longer lives with the custodial parent or has moved in with you.
	You have moved in with the custodial parent.


How do I terminate a child support order?&nbsp;


	call the CSEA and request termination, or
	file a Motion to Terminate Child Support with the Court.


If you file a motion with the Court, they will either send you a notice that child support has terminated or schedule a hearing on the matter. At the hearing, be prepared to prove that one of these events has occurred.

Juvenile Courts
Parental Rights & Obligations
Termination of Parental Rights",,Family Law,"If your children are being abused, neglected or are dependent for support upon a non-parent, an action can be filed in Juvenile Court. The court will hold a hearing to decide the facts. The court will decide what action to take to protect the children.

Any person with knowledge including a Children’s Services caseworker can file this action. The complaint must state facts that show that a child is abused, neglected or dependent.

There are three hearings. The first hearing, called a shelter care hearing, must be held within 72 hours after the child is placed in detention or shelter care or the next day, whichever is earlier. The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether detention or shelter care is needed. Before the hearing the court must tell the parties about their right to counsel. At the hearing the court may consider any evidence; it is not limited by the formal rules of evidence. The court will determine if there are any suitable relatives where the child could be placed and who is willing to act as temporary custodians.

The second hearing, an adjudicatory hearing, will be held within thirty days after the complaint is filed. A continuance may be granted to extend the time to no later than sixty days after the complaint is filed. At this hearing, the Court will determine whether the child is abused, neglected or dependent.

The Court can issue temporary orders before the second hearing.

These orders must be in the best interest of the child. They can include:


	granting temporary custody to a parent, relative or other person or agency;
	changing visitation rights;
	child support or health insurance orders;
	orders requiring a party to leave a residence;
	orders for counseling;
	restraining orders ;
	orders for testing for physical examination, psychological evaluation and drug/alcohol testing;
	to appoint a Guardian Ad Litem to investigate and make recommendations to the court on behalf of the child.


After this hearing, the third or ‘dispositional’ hearing is scheduled to decide the final resolution of the case. This third hearing is to be held at least one day but not more than thirty days after the second hearing. A continuance may be granted to extend the time to no later than ninety days after the filing of the complaint.

All witnesses and evidence about the case should be at the hearing.

Following the hearing, the court can:


	place the child in protective supervision;
	place the child in the temporary custody of a children services agency (foster care);
	give legal custody to either parent or any other person who has requested legal custody;
	place the child in the permanent custody of a children service agency; or
	place the child in long-term foster care.


THE RIGHT TO AN APPOINTED ATTORNEY

Parents have the right to request a court appointed attorney if a state agency has filed to terminate parental rights or seek custody in Juvenile Court. If you cannot afford an attorney, you should contact the court to request one.

Parental Rights & Obligations
Termination of Parental Rights",,Family Law,"A motion to terminate a parent’s rights is usually the last step taken by a children’s service’s agency. Before that, parent’s may be given time to improve their situation. Often parents are required to participate in a case plan. The case plan sets out the issues that parents must solve or improve. Parents may be required to take classes, get stable housing or seek counseling. If the situation doesn’t improve the agency will take further steps.

Motion for Permanent Custody If a child has been in the temporary custody of an agency for 12 months in a 24 month period, the agency is required to file a motion for permanent custody. The agency may file for permanent custody if the child was neglected, abused or dependent.

Whether the agency files a motion for permanent custody depends on certain factors. It depends on the situation that lead to the placement of the child with the agency. It depends on the progress made by the parents to over-come those problems.

The agency must establish that it is in the child’s best interest to grant permanent custody.

The agency must also prove that:


	the child cannot be placed with his parents in a reasonable time; or
	should not be placed with his parents; or
	the child is abandoned; or
	the child is orphaned and no relatives can take him; or
	the child has been in the temporary custody of an agency for 12 of 24 consecutive months.


The agency must make a good faith effort to implement a case plan to reunify the parents and child. However, the agency does not have to implement every part of the case plan. A court will grant permanent custody if the parents fail to meet the plan requirements.

Once an order granting permanent custody is issued, the parents are no longer parties in the case, except as to appeal.

Right to Appointed Counsel:

Parents must receive proper notice that a motion for permanent custody has been filed. Parents have legal rights. Those rights include the right to a full hearing and the right to appointed counsel. Parents should call the court to request an attorney immediately.

There is no legal action to end your own responsibilities as a parent. No parent may terminate the rights of the other parent.

However, step-parents may seek to adopt a child. Probate Court will usually grant a step-parent adoption if the other parent has failed to communicate or support the child for over a one year. If the adoption is granted, parental rights and the duty to support end.

A parent may consent to the adoption of his or her child by another. An adoption terminates all parental rights.

Emancipation:

There is no Ohio law that allows a parent to emancipate a child in order to end the duty to support. The duty to support can continue beyond age 18. This can occur if the child is not able to support himself due to pre-existing physical or mental disabilities.

A minor may become emancipated by marriage, self-support and /or residence beyond the care and control of parents. The emancipation of a child who is capable of supporting himself discharges parents from their duty to provide support. However, if the child becomes unable to support himself, the duty to support may revive.

A child may seek to have himself declared emancipated in Probate Court in order to sue for injury and to settle a claim.

93,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/101,Guardianship for a Child Fact Sheet,Guardianship,,Family Law,"A guardian is usually an adult person, agency or trust department of a bank appointed by the Probate Court to take responsibility for the care and management of a person and or his property (estate).

Why does a child need a guardian?

A guardian may be appointed for a child who is under 18 years old because the parents are deceased or because the parents are unable or unsuitable to care for the child.

Money Settlement

Parents do not have an absolute right to settle personal injury claims on behalf of their minor child. The Probate Court must approve of such settlements. If the settlement is more than $10,000, the Court will require the appointment of a guardian of the estate. Insurance companies may require a guardian to be appointed before settling a claim. Personal injury or damage claims by minors may be settled without the appointment of a guardian if the settlement of the claim will be less than $10,000.

Who Chooses the Guardian?

Probate Court appoints a guardian to serve both for the person and the estate of the ward. A separate guardian for the estate is only appointed if the court decides it’s necessary. A minor over age 14 or the parents through a will may request a specific person to be the guardian for a minor.

What Is the Appointment Procedure?

An ‘interested party’ or the Probate Court itself may file to have a guardian appointed. The application is filed in the county where the ward lives. The application must include a statement by the guardian that he is willing to act as guardian and a bond as required by law.

The child’s parents are served with the application. They receive notice of the date and time of a hearing. The hearing is held by a judge or magistrate. The court determines if a guardian is necessary, suitable and understands his duties.

What Are The Types of Guardianships?

A guardian may be appointed as either guardian of the person, the estate or both. A guardian of the person controls and protects the minor child. A guardian of the estate controls and protects the property of the child.

Responsibilities of the Guardian

Accounting:

A guardian must file an inventory within 30 days after appointment. A guardian of the estate must file a written account with the Court at least every two years. The account shows the income and expenses of the child’s estate.

Citations:

If a guardian fails to timely file a report, inventory or accounting, the Court may cite a guardian to appear. The Court may issue a fine, reduce the guardian's fee, or remove the guardian.

Prior Approval:

The guardian must obtain the approval of Probate Court before entering into a contract or lease, selling assets or settling any personal injury claim for the ward.

Removal:

The Court may at any time remove the guardian if required for the best interest of the ward.

Terminating guardianship

A guardian may apply to end a guardianship if the estate is less than $10,000. After approval by the court, the funds may be transferred either:


	to an account to be given to the child when the child is 18; or
	to be delivered to a parent of the minor.


Custody vs. Guardianship

Non-parents may seek legal control over minors by filing for guardianship in Probate Court or for legal custody in Juvenile Court. Probate Court has jurisdiction over the estates of minors and over insurance settlements.

"
94,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/104,What You Should Know About Child Support,Child Support,,Family Law,"Child support is ordered by a court, the Child Support Enforcement Agency or established by agreement of the parties.

Who pays child support?

In general, the “non-residential” parent pays child support to the “residential” parent. In shared parenting plans, the amount of support may be directly related to the amount of time the child spends in each parent’s home.

How is child support calculated?

Child support is calculated according to a written formula in state law. That formula combines the father’s and mother’s gross income. Certain deductions can be taken for local income tax and child or spousal support for other children or former spouses. In addition the value of a federal dependency exemption for each dependent in your household can be deducted from your gross income. For example, assume you have a child by a new marriage and a non-residential child from a previous marriage. You would reduce your gross income by the amount of the child dependency deduction before calculating support for the child of your earlier marriage. If you were ordered to pay spousal support to a former spouse, the amount of the spousal support is deducted from your gross income and added to your former spouse’s income.

The total of both parents’ adjusted gross income is added together. The child support guideline chart shows the amount of support based on the parents’ income category. The paying parent will pay a pro-rated share of that amount. For example, if Mom earns $10,000 per year, and Dad earns $30,000, the combined gross income is $40,000. If Dad is the parent paying support, he must pay 75% of the guideline amount, because he earns 75% of the total combined parental income.

What about day care expenses or health insurance costs?

Work-related day care expenses and health insurance coverage for the child are added to the amount of child support. For example, assume the guideline amount is $4,000 per year. Mom also pays $1500 per year for day care while at work. Dad pays $500 per year for the child’s medical insurance coverage. The total child support cost is $6,000 per year. This total cost is divided between the parents based on each parent’s percentage of their total earnings.

The court usually orders health insurance coverage, if available at reasonable cost. If no affordable coverage is available, the parents must share the health care costs. Each parent is usually order to pay uncovered medical costs based on their percentage of the parent’s total earnings; the residential parent pays the first $100 per year.

If I pay child support, do I automatically get to claim the child on my tax return?

Federal tax law gives the dependency exemption to the custodial parent. However, state courts have the power to award the exemption to the non-custodial parent if it will result in a net tax saving that benefit the child.

How long does child support last?

&nbsp;Child support must be paid until the child reaches the age of 18 or graduates high school, whichever is later. If a child is no longer attending high school and is not living with or dependent upon a parent, then child support may end before age 18. If a child is more than 18 years of age and still attends high school, support will continue until the child has completed high school, up to age 19, unless otherwise ordered or agreed.

Special rules may apply to disabled children. A child support order may last well beyond a disabled child’s 18th birthday. How long depends on the child’s ability to be independent.

A court can order or change child support only until a child turns age 18, with the exception of handicapped children and those still in high school after age 18. This is true even when a child over 18 is entirely dependent upon his parents. If parents agree in a court order to support a child beyond the age of 18 (to pay for college, for example), then the court can enforce that agreement.

Courts cannot order support for a child born out of wedlock until paternity is determined. Support must then be paid from the child’s birth until “emancipation” (age 18 or independence).

What if court-ordered support isn't paid?

All support orders must be paid. Payment can be made in one of three ways.


	Most common is the “wage order” in which the amount of child support is taken directly from the wages of the person owing support. Or child support may be taken from a bank account.
	Self-employed persons are required to post cash bonds that may be used if the payor misses a payment. The payee is paid from the bond. The payor must reimburse the bond fund.
	A “reporting” order is issued by the court when a parent is unemployed. The parent must report to the Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) regularly about their job search and income.


A CSEA support officer can seek to enforce an order by filing contempt motions and by garnishing wages or bank accounts. The CSEA can take certain income to meet past due support. For example, a tax refund, company bonus or similar lump sum can be taken to pay long overdue child support.

Certain licenses cannot be renewed for those who fail to pay child support. For instance, recreational, professional and drivers’ licenses cannot be renewed if a license-holder owes past due child support.

Can I deny companionship/visitation if my ex doesn't pay support? Can I stop paying support if my ex denies visitation/companionship?

No! If you deliberately fail to obey these court orders, you could be found in contempt of court. Contempt is punishable by a jail sentence, a fine, attorney fees, and court costs. Also, if your ex seeks a change of custody, your deliberate withholding of visitation or child support will be an important factor in deciding who should be the residential parent. Use the law to enforce court orders.

119,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/141,Civil Stalking Fact Sheet,Orders of Protection,,Family Law,"Civil Stalking Fact Sheet: What you should know about Civil Stalking and Sexually Oriented Offense Protection Orders

What is a Civil Stalking or Sexually Oriented Offense Protection Order?

It is much like a domestic violence Civil Protection Order. These orders can protect victims even if they are not a family or household member of the abuser. Victims who have been threatened with physical harm or mental distress by an abuser more than once recently can seek a Civil Stalking Protection Order (CSPO). Victims of a sexual offense can seek a Sexually Oriented Offense Protection Order after the first threat.

In this fact sheet they will both be referred to as CSPOs.

How can I obtain a CSPO?

A victim can file a petition with the court of common pleas general division (not domestic relations).&nbsp; If the stalker is under 18 years old, the petition must be filed in juvenile court. The petition must be filed in the county where the victim lives. Protection order forms are available from the clerk of the common pleas court. There is no filing fee.

Can I get immediate protection?

You can ask the court to issue an ex parte (immediate) protection order before the full hearing. You will have to meet with the judge or magistrate to testify. The judge will issue an ex parte protection order you are in an immediate and present danger. ""Immediate and present danger"" exists if either the stalker has threatened bodily harm or has been convicted of menacing by stalking or a sexually oriented offense.

What happens once I get an ex parte CSPO?

The court will schedule a full hearing within 10 days. The petition must be delivered by the sheriff to the stalker. At the hearing, you and your stalker can present testimony, witnesses and other evidence to prove or disprove the stalking. If the judge believes that the stalking occurred and you are in danger, the judge will issue a Full Hearing CSPC. This order should be delivered to the stalker on the same day it is issued. It is a valid order which police and sheriff’s departments must enforce.

How can a CSPO protect me?

All CSPOs prohibit the stalker or sexual offender from harming, threatening, following, harassing, contacting, or forcing sexual relations on the victim. A CSPO can also:


	require the stalker or sexual offender to stay away from you;
	prohibit the stalker or sexual offender from shutting off your utilities, canceling insurance or health benefits, or interfering with your phone service or mail delivery; and
	prohibit the stalker from removing or harming your property or pets.


A CSPO may contain other terms to protect you including:


	prohibit the stalker or sexual offender from entering your residence, school, business, or place of employment or that of your family or household;
	prohibit the stalker from possessing firearms or other deadly weapons; and
	that it cannot be waived or nullified just because you invite or consent to the stalker entering your residence, school, business, or place of employment.


However, a CSPO, unlike a domestic violence CPO, cannot include orders for spousal or child support, custody, visitation, personal property or motor vehicles.

How long is my CSPO valid?

A CSPO will remain valid until the date listed in the order, up to five years. You can seek an extension by filing a motion before it ends.

What are the penalties for violating a CPO or CSPO?

The penalties are the same for violating a CPO or a CSPO. A first conviction is a first degree misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a fine up to $1,000. A second or additional conviction is a felony of the fifth degree, punishable by a mandatory prison term of six to twelve months, and/or a fine up to $2,500.

Is a CPO or a CSPO issued in one county enforceable in other counties or states?

Yes. If a victim flees, law enforcement and courts in the new county must enforce the protection order.

A victim can register a protection order in the new county by filing a certified copy of the protection order with the municipal court (for criminal orders) or the court of common pleas (for civil orders) in the new county. By registering your CPO or CSPO, you put local law enforcement on notice that the order exists. However, law enforcement must enforce a CPO or CSPO whether it is registered or not.

If I request a CSPO, can my stalker or sexual abuser also obtain a protection order against me?

No, unless:


	the stalker or sexual offender files a separate petition at least 48 hours before the full hearing; and
	the stalker or sexual offender presents evidence that convinces the judge that you were also a stalker or sexual offender.


Otherwise, the court has no authority to issue a mutual protection order against you.

Can a victim advocate (non-attorney) accompany me to all the hearings?

Yes. However, in most courts a non-attorney victim advocate cannot present arguments or evidence (act like an attorney) at the hearing. The victim, if she is not represented by an attorney, must present her own case to the court.

There are two types of protection orders in Ohio. One is a Civil Protection Order.
The other is a Civil Stalking or Sexually Orientated Offense Protection Order.
Either can order an individual to stay away from and not contact you. A protection
order can last for up to five years. A violation of either order is a criminal offense.

Civil Protection Order (CPO)

A CPO can include orders for children. The court can award temporary child
custody, visitation and support. These orders only last as long as the CPO is in
effect. The court can also award the use of a joint residence, personal property, or
a vehicle.
A person applying for a CPO must have one of these relationships with the abuser:
 You lived with the abuser and are or were married to the abuser; or
 In the last five years, you lived with the abuser in a relationship that
resembles marriage; or
 You lived with the abuser and the abuser is or was related to you through
blood, marriage, or a relationship resembling marriage; or
 You have a child with the abuser.
To obtain a CPO, you must show that the abuser harmed you. You must prove that
your abuser harmed you or a family or household member by:
o attempting to cause serious bodily injury; or
o recklessly causing bodily injury; or
o child endangerment or child abuse; or
o rape, gross sexual imposition, or other sexually orientated offense; or
o harassing two or more times in a way that made you fearful of harm.
These acts must happen close in time.

debt, public benefit or housing problem. Call Community Legal Aid Services
at 1-800-998-9454 or apply 24/7 online at www.communitylegalservices.org

&nbsp;

STALKING CIVIL PROTECTION ORDER OR&nbsp;SEXUALLY ORIENTATED OFFENSE PROTECTION ORDER

This order helps protect victims of sexual assault or stalking. A
Common Pleas Court issues this order. If the offender is a minor,
Juvenile Court hears the case.
This order does not require any type of family relationship.
You must show that your abuser harmed you by:
 harassing you two or more times in a way that made you fear harm. These
acts must happen close in time; or
 rape, gross sexual imposition or other violent acts that have a sexual
motivation.

&nbsp;

OBTAINING A PROTECTION ORDER

It is best to have a lawyer or legal advocate help you. Contact your local
domestic violence shelter for help. Ask for an interpreter, if you need
help communicating.
The first step is to file a petition with a court. Clerks of court have blank petitions.
There is no cost to file a petition for a protection order.
You can ask for immediate protection. The court can grant an order the same day
you request it. You must show there is an immediate danger.
Then, the court will set a full hearing date and time. The full hearing will be in the
next 7 to 10 days. At the full hearing, the abuser will have a chance to contest your
version of events.
At the hearing, you will need to prove what you said in the petition. You do this by
presenting evidence. Your testimony is evidence. So is the testimony of other
witnesses. Your witnesses must have direct knowledge. They must have seen the
abuse or threat or the result of the abuse, such as bruises.
A full hearing protection order lasts for a specific time, up to 5 years. It can be
extended before it expires. The protection order can prohibit contact, threats, and
stalking. It can include other protections. A CPO can include temporary orders for
child custody and support and possession of property and a vehicle.
IF YOU NEED SHELTER due to domestic violence, call ODVN 800-934-9840 or
log on to http://www.odvn.org/survivor/shelter.html to find help and the shelter
nearest you.

&nbsp;

SHERRY KARABIN
Legal News Reporter
Published: November 15, 2016

Divorce and dignity—two words that are seldom used together. But Austintown attorney Melissa Rocci believes that with the right tools, it’s definitely possible to “divorce with dignity.”

It’s an idea she began embracing after going through her own divorce about 14 years ago. In 2002, Rocci split from her husband Amar Dasari, the father of her two daughters, Selena, 22 and Ava, 17.

“I know firsthand both the freedom and the struggles of raising children as a single parent,” she said.

“I now use the simple methods that I have learned to help my clients through the process,” said Rocci, who primarily handles divorce and custody matters. “Helping them to diffuse emotions and focus on the positive parts of their life while envisioning a peaceful happy future, they can settle their cases faster and preserve family relationships. A client with a positive attitude not only helps their case, but their children and their future.”

In 2014 Rocci published the book, “Courageous Wings Within: Growing Through Divorce to Live an Extraordinary Life,” in which she discusses overcoming some of her own challenges.

“In the book I talk about my personal journey through divorce and how I positively transformed my life,” said Rocci. “I want people to know that you are not alone and you are not a failure. Rather you are on a journey of self-discovery and happiness.”

Born and raised in Austintown, Rocci received her bachelor’s degree in English language and literature from Youngstown State University and her juris doctor from California Western School of Law in San Diego.

Rocci, who is licensed in California and Ohio, spent a year at a law firm in San Diego.

She moved back to Ohio when her oldest daughter was born, taking a job at Rural Legal Aid in Troy.

Prior to starting her own law practice in February 2005, she served as an assistant law director for the city of Newark and worked as an associate at the Engler-Vivo law firm.

A certified family law mediator, Rocci encourages all her clients to use mediation and negotiation to work out their divorce settlements, which she said reduces the stress and expense of a court battle. She is a court-appointed mediator for both the domestic relations courts in both Mahoning and Columbiana counties.

“I believe my clients want more than just legal help,” she said. “One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is helping a client who walks in the door scared and anxious to come out of this process uplifted and ready to begin the next chapter of his or her life.

“No one gets married to get divorced,” said Rocci. “And we can’t control what happens to us. But I believe very strongly that we can choose how we respond to what happens to us. There are simple tools that we can use to change our lives.”

Her legal assistant, Terrie Crogan, described Rocci as a “huge blessing in my life as well as in her clients’ lives. She puts her clients at ease because she has gone through the process herself and she fully understands their fears and emotions,” said Crogan.

Outside of her law practice, Rocci often speaks about divorce and other topics. Most recently she did so at an event for Empowering Women in the Mahoning Valley. She also posts inspirational messages on her Facebook page “Attorney Melissa Rocci.”

In addition, she volunteers at Community Legal Aid Services Inc.’s pro se divorce clinic on a regular basis. The clinic is located at Community Legal Aid’s offices in downtown Youngstown.

“My job at Rural Legal Aid shaped my philosophy about giving back,” said Rocci. “Pro bono work is really important. A lot of people can’t afford a lawyer, but they need access to the court justice system.”

Her efforts in the pro se clinic earned her Community Legal Aid’s Mahoning County Volunteer of the Year Award. The award was presented on Sept. 12 at The Mahoning County Bar Association Opening of Courts luncheon at Mount Carmel Hall in Youngstown.

“Melissa has been one of our volunteers since 2008,” said Steven McGarrity, associate director of Community Legal Aid. “She volunteers at our pro se divorce clinic once a month.

“She assists our clients at the clinic with simple divorces who need assistance filing,” said McGarrity. “We do not have the staff to do it. She walks them through the process of filling out the paperwork and explains how to represent themselves at court. I think her work in her private practice to help people ‘divorce with dignity’ really makes a difference in the lives of her clients who are going through some challenging times.”

In 2013, Rocci joined forces with&nbsp;Crogan and Robyn Podboy&nbsp;to found the Happiness Coalition. The organization features&nbsp;a variety of programs like women’s empowerment gatherings,&nbsp;tropical&nbsp;retreats/conferences, Infinite Possibilities workshops and&nbsp;divorce support groups, aimed at helping participants to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

“We&nbsp;inspire people to change their perception, thoughts and practices and to tap into the magic of life and amp up their happiness,” said Podboy, a&nbsp;life coach and of owner of RP Life Consulting.&nbsp;“Everyone has the power to&nbsp;create the life they truly desire.&nbsp;Inspiring others to lead happier, more fulfilling lives is our true passion. It is very rewarding to see others rediscover themselves&nbsp;as they take this journey toward personal growth.&nbsp;

“Melissa is very passionate about the work that she does to help others&nbsp;become empowered,” said Podboy. “She believes and practices what she teaches in her own life. Melissa is always inspiring others to live&nbsp;an extraordinary life with more love, peace and joy.”

“We explain to our clients that happiness is a choice,” said Crogan. “Whatever type of energy a person puts out in the universe is what they get back.

“I’ve watched people walk through our doors for the very first time with their chins on the ground and ultimately leave completely turned around.”

Rocci is a member of The Mahoning County Bar Association, where she serves on the continuing legal education committee. She is also a member of the Austintown Rotary and the Mahoning Valley chapter of Polka Dot Powerhouse, which seeks to create “genuine connections of positive, drama-free, action-forward women.”

In the future Rocci said she would like to develop an online program or app so more people going through divorce could benefit from her legal experience and life tools. She would also like to create a continuing legal education course for divorce and custody attorneys that addresses how to meet the unique needs of their clients.

“I will continue to make the most of each one of my days and encourage all who come across my path to do the same,” said Rocci.

Rocci’s book can be purchased on Amazon.com. For more information on the Happiness Coalition go to (http://happinesscoalition.com/).

95,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/107,COBRA: Continuation of Group Health Coverage,COBRA,,Health,"A federal law called COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) gives the right in certain situations to have health coverage at group rates for a limited time (18 to 36 months).

Who qualifies for extended coverage under COBRA?

This coverage is only available to certain persons when coverage is lost due to specific events.

To qualify for COBRA benefits, you must meet all three elements below:

Your employer must already provide a group health plan and have 20 or more employees.&nbsp; Part-time employees are counted on a fractional basis.

COBRA applies to employees, the employee's spouse or an employee's dependent child who are covered by a group health plan.

The employee, spouse or dependent face losing health coverage for one of the following reasons.&nbsp; These are called qualifying events.

Employees:


	Termination of employment other than for gross misconduct;
	Reduction in the number of hours of employment;
	Eligibility for Medicare.


Spouses:


	Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered employee's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; employment for any reason other than gross misconduct
	Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee
	Covered employee's becoming entitled to Medicare
	Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee
	Death of the covered employee


Dependent Children:

same as for spouses with one addition


	Loss of dependent child status under the plan rules.


How Do I find Out About COBRA?


	The employer must tell the employee about COBRA when coverage under a group health plan begins.
	The plan administrator must notify the employee of the right to continue coverage after a qualifying event happens.
	The employee must notify the plan administrator of divorce, legal separation, disability or minor child losing dependent status.
	The employee or spouse or child has 60 days to elect to sign up for extended insurance coverage.


Do I have to pay for extended coverage?&nbsp;

Usually, yes.&nbsp; The premium cannot be more than 102% of the usual cost of the plan.&nbsp; Premiums may be increased.&nbsp; Other terms may apply.&nbsp; The first payment must be made within 45 days after you elect to take COBRA.&nbsp; You must pay co-payments and deductibles.&nbsp; There may be benefit limits.

How do I file a COBRA claim for benefits

Submit a claim for benefits under your plan's rules for filing claims.&nbsp; If the claim is denied, you must be given notice of the denial in writing (usually within 90 days).&nbsp; The notice should state the reasons for the denial, any additional information needed, and how to appeal the denial.

You will have at least 60 days to appeal a denial.&nbsp; You must receive a decision on the appeal generally within 60 days after that.

Contact the plan administrator for more information on filing a claim for benefits. Complete plan rules are available from employers or benefits offices. There can be charges up to 25 cents a page for copies of plan rules.

Under COBRA, what benefits must be covered

Generally, coverage should be the same as before.&nbsp; A change in the benefits for the active employees will also apply to qualified beneficiaries.

How long does COBRA coverage last?

Generally, COBRA beneficiaries are eligible for group coverage for up to 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work.&nbsp; Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial coverage, may extend coverage to 36 months.&nbsp; Other laws may extend coverage.&nbsp; See www.dol.gov for more information.

Coverage may end earlier if:


	Premiums are not paid timely
	The employer ceases to maintain any group health plan
	Coverage is obtained with another employer group health plan with no pre-existing limitation
	After the COBRA election, a beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare benefits.


COBRA does not prohibit plans from offering continuation health coverage that goes beyond the COBRA periods.

Can I qualify for longer coverage?&nbsp;

Maybe.

Disability can extend the 18 month period of continuation coverage for a qualifying event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours.&nbsp; See dol.gov for specific information on how to qualify.

Can I receive COBRA benefits while on FMLA leave

The Family and Medical Leave Act requires an employer to maintain coverage under any group health plan for an employee on FMLA leave under the same conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued working.&nbsp; Coverage provided under the FMLA is not COBRA coverage, and FMLA leave is not a qualifying event under COBRA.

97,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/109,How to Obtain Health Insurance through Open Enrollment,Health Insurance,,Health,"Ohio law requires certain insurance carriers to offer health insurance at a limited cost to people who apply on a first-come, first-served basis. Under this program, called Open Enrollment, there is a choice of Basic or Standard benefit plans. Participating carriers have a limited number of policies of this type that they must provide by law.

If you meet certain requirements, you can’t be turned down for this coverage even if you are sick. However, insurance carriers are not required to accept applicants who, at the time of enrollment, are confined to a health care facility due to chronic illness or permanent injury.

You must meet either the requirements listed below as a Federally Eligible Individual (FEI) or as a Non-Federally Eligible Individual (Non-FEI), in order to sign up for Open Enrollment coverage. If you qualify as an FEI, your coverage will be effective immediately upon enrollment without pre-existing condition exclusions. If you do not qualify as an FEI, you may still be eligible for coverage as a Non-FEI. However, the carrier may require up to a 90-day waiting period for your coverage to be effective. The carrier also may exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions for up to the first 12 months from your effective date.

You can qualify as a Federally Eligible Individual (FEI), if:


	You had health coverage for at least 18 months without a break in coverage greater than 63 days.
	Your most recent health coverage was under an employer group health plan, governmental plan or church plan.
	You are not eligible for coverage under any of the following plans:



	An employer group health plan,
	Medicare
	Medicaid



	You do not have any other health coverage.
	Your most recent health coverage was not terminated due to nonpayment of premiums or fraud.
	If you had been offered the option to continue coverage under COBRA or a state continuation plan, you both elected and exhausted the continuation coverage.


You may need to submit proof of previous creditable coverage.

OR

You can qualify as a Non-Federally Eligible Individual (Non-FEI), if:


	You are not applying for coverage as an employee of an employer, member of an association or member of any other employer group.
	You do not have any other health coverage and are not eligible to be covered under any private or public health benefit plans including the following:



	Medicare or Medicare supplement policy
	Medicaid
	Any COBRA or state continuation coverage plan
	Other health benefits arrangement

Collection/Repossession
Garnishment",,Health,"What To Do When You Have a Medical Bill

Did you really receive the services?

If not, tell the bill collector that you disagree with the bill because you did not receive the services. You don't need a lawyer to do that. Put it in writing and keep a copy of the letter. Be polite. The office may have made an honest mistake.

Ask your doctors for itemized bills. Review the services provided and the services you are being billed for. Get another copy if you lost the original bill.

Is someone else responsible for the bill?

Were you hurt at work or on someone else's property? Do you have a child custody order that includes medical support? Were you injured in an accident that was someone else's fault? Should Medicaid or Medicare cover these costs?

If someone else should pay the bill, ask them to pay it. Tell your doctor that someone else is responsible for the bills and that you have asked them to pay.

Do you have insurance? Private? Medicaid? Medicare?

If yes: send the bill to your insurance company. Make sure that your doctor knows that you have insurance and that you have sent the bill to the company. Ask your doctor for help filling out the claim forms for insurance. Often the doctor's office will submit the claim forms for you.

If you don't have insurance: are you eligible for any health insurance through your job, or Medicaid or Medicare? Review the prior sections fact sheet which talk about different health insurance programs to you figure out if you. Some of the programs may even be able to cover old bills that you already have.

What if nobody else will pay?

If you don't have insurance and don't qualify for any of the programs described, you should try to set up a payment plan with your doctor. You would agree to pay something every month until your bill is paid off. The doctor does not have to agree to this but might, to avoid having to sue you. Tell your doctor how much you can pay, what income you have and what other bills you have.

If your doctor agrees to accept a payment plan, make sure that you always make the payment. Don't offer to pay more than you can.

If you cannot pay your bills and they are very large you may wish to consider debt reduction options.

Medicaid

Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income people.&nbsp; Applicants must meet income and asset guidelines.&nbsp; The coverage can be free or a ‘spend-down’ must be met.&nbsp; Medicaid covers most office visits, prescription drugs, tests, hospital and nursing home costs.

Medicaid is available to:


	persons with income below 138% of the federal poverty guidelines;
	children with household income below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines;
	OWF and SSI recipients, and;
	Low-income pregnant women and parents/caretakers of minor children.


You can get more information and apply for Medicaid at your county Department of Job and Family Services.&nbsp; You can also apply online at www.Benefits.Ohio.gov.

Medicare

Medicare is a public health insurance program for workers who are 65 or older, or disabled.&nbsp; Medicare does not cover as much as Medicaid.&nbsp; Medicare eligibility does not depend on your income or assets.

Medicare has three parts.&nbsp; Part A is free and covers the costs of hospitalization, skilled nursing care, hospice and some in-home care.&nbsp; Part B is extra coverage that you may choose to purchase—it is not free.&nbsp; Part B covers doctor bills, outpatient services, tests, and medical equipment.&nbsp; Part D is limited prescription medication coverage.&nbsp; It’s also not free.

You can get more information and apply for Medicare through your local Social Security Administration office.

Private Insurance under the Affordable Care Act

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) set up a market place for private health insurance.&nbsp; It allows you to compare insurance plans before you buy.&nbsp; It’s an ‘apples to apples’ comparison.&nbsp; All health insurance plans must cover doctor visits, hospital costs and prescriptions. Preventive care is free. You cannot be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition.

Many households can receive financial help to cover the costs.&nbsp; But to get help you must get insurance through the ACA market place.&nbsp; You can get more information at www.getcoveredAmerica.org.&nbsp; Apply online at www.healthcare.gov.&nbsp; Or call 1-800-318-2596 available 24/7 (except Federal holidays). You can also get free help to apply.&nbsp; A list of ‘navigators’ is available at either of these websites.&nbsp; Need more help finding help?&nbsp;&nbsp; See communitylegalaid.org.

Veterans Benefits

The Veterans Administration provides health services in hospital and clinics throughout the U.S.&nbsp; Certain procedures and services may be free, others may require a co-pay.

The VA health system is available to veterans who have served a full term of active duty, disabled veterans, and many others.&nbsp; All low-income veterans should apply.

Find more information at http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/epublications.asp.&nbsp; Apply on-line at www.va.gov or at your local Veterans Service Commission office.

DA Medical

DA Medical is health coverage for disabled individuals who receive DFA.&nbsp; DFA is income for persons who have a physical or mental disability.&nbsp; The disability must be so severe as to prevent employment for at least nine months.

You can get more information and apply for DFA at your county Department of Job and Family Services.&nbsp; If your application is denied and you don't know why, call the Legal Helpline.

Public Health Care Clinics

Public health care clinics (PHCs) provide services on a sliding-fee scale basis (the less you earn, the less you pay).&nbsp; PHCs must provide certain services free of charge.&nbsp; Call 211 or your local information and referral agency to see if there is a PHC in your area.

Hospital Care Assurance Program (HCAP) and Hospital Charity Care

Some hospitals offer free or reduced cost treatment to individuals and families.&nbsp; Household income must be below a certain level.&nbsp; HCAP is a program that requires hospitals to offer free treatment.&nbsp; Low-income individuals must have household income below the federal poverty level.

Charity care covers many hospital services.&nbsp; It does not cover doctor's bills or take-home prescriptions.&nbsp; For example, it will cover the cost of a hospital room but not your surgeon’s fee.

You can get more information and apply through your hospital's billing department.&nbsp; Or ask the hospital's social worker.&nbsp; Your doctor may also offer free care.

COBRA

Covered employees and their families who received health insurance through work are allowed to buy that same coverage.&nbsp; There are restrictions.&nbsp; The coverage is limited to 18 or 36 months.&nbsp; The employee must have quit, been fired or changed jobs and lost health insurance.&nbsp; COBRA coverage is also available if a divorce results in lost coverage.&nbsp; Employers must inform their employees of this program.

If you or a family member recently lost health insurance that had been provided by a job, you should call the company and ask for a COBRA notice.&nbsp; If they refuse to give you this notice, call the Legal Aid Helpline at 1-800-998-9454.

Free Prescription Programs

Many drug companies offer free or low-cost prescription drugs. These programs differ from company to company.&nbsp; If you take a medication every month, ask your doctor about any offer to lower your costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask your doctor or druggist to call the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA) for information on drug savings programs.&nbsp; The PMA can be reached toll-free at 1-800-PMA-INFO.

Ohio’s Best Rx

Is open to all Ohioans.&nbsp; The program saves participants money through negotiated drug prices and manufacturer rebates. Uninsured participants save the most.&nbsp; A Best Rx participant pays the ""Best Rx price.""&nbsp; Apply online at “Ohio’s Best Rx.”

Local and County Health Departments

Health departments provide many different services for low or no cost.&nbsp; Services may include physicals, immunizations, blood tests, health screening and wellness education. Call your health department to find out what services they will provide.

Other local Health Care Options

There may be other health care options.&nbsp; Contact your local 211 or information and referral agency to find out.&nbsp; Some doctors volunteer to help through a free clinic.

100,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/112,Public and Subsidized Housing,Federal Housing Programs,,Housing,"What is the difference between public housing and subsidized housing?

Both public housing and subsidized housing provide decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Public housing and subsidized housing come in many types: from single family houses to high-rise apartments.&nbsp; A local Public Housing Authority (HA) directly manages public housing and sets the rent at an affordable amount.

For some subsidized housing, the tenant must obtain a voucher from the HA.&nbsp; The tenant then searches for housing owned by a private landlord.&nbsp; The HA directly subsidizes the rent the tenant pays to the landlord.&nbsp; The HA also requires an inspection to ensure that the unit is decent and safe.

Another type of subsidized housing is site-based.&nbsp; This is usually housing for the elderly or disabled.&nbsp; Tenants do not need a voucher but must be eligible.

Who is eligible?

Public and subsidized housing are limited to low-income families and individuals.&nbsp; The HA decides who is eligible based on:


	annual gross income (HAs use income limits set by HUD);
	whether you qualify as elderly, a person with a disability, or as a family; and
	U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status.


If you are eligible, the HA will check your references to make sure you and your family will be good tenants.&nbsp; HAs will deny admission to any applicant whose habits and practices may be expected to have a detrimental effect on other tenants or on the housing environment.&nbsp; In general, the HA will look for the following: no unpaid debts owed to the housing authority; decent credit record; good rental history; no evictions; no record of disturbing neighbors; no record of destroying property; and no serious or recent criminal record.&nbsp; If you have a bad record, be prepared to show how you would now be a good tenant.

How do I apply?

Apply at your local HA.&nbsp; There is a written application to complete.&nbsp; There may be a long waiting list for certain types of housing.&nbsp; Apply well before you need to move in.

How does the application process work?

Be prepared to give information, such as:


	The name, birth date, gender and relationship to the head of household for each person who will be living in the unit;
	Your current address and telephone number;
	Family circumstances that might qualify the family for a preference, such as being a veteran, being homeless or living in substandard housing;
	Names and addresses of current and prior landlords.&nbsp; The HA will seek information about your history as a tenant;
	An estimate of your family's anticipated income for the next twelve months and the sources of that income;
	The names and addresses of employers, banks, and any other information the HA needs to verify your income and deductions, and to verify the family composition; and
	The HA also may visit you in your home to interview you and your family to see how you manage the upkeep of your current home.


The HA representative should describe the public housing program and its requirements, and answer any questions you might have.

Will I need to produce any documentation?

Yes.&nbsp; The HA representative will request whatever documents are needed (e.g., birth certificates, tax returns) to verify the information given on your application.&nbsp; You will be asked to sign an authorization to release information to the HA.

How will I be notified?

The HA must provide you with a written notice.&nbsp; If you are eligible, your name will be put on a waiting list, unless the HA is able to assist you immediately.&nbsp; Once your name is reached on the waiting list, the HA will contact you. However, you should contact the HA every six months to indicate your continued interest and to up date them with any address or other contact information change.

What if I am denied?

If you are found ineligible, the HA must state why.&nbsp; You can request an informal hearing.&nbsp; You can present evidence that your situation has changed.&nbsp; You can have witnesses who know your current situation.&nbsp; You can have an attorney help you at the hearing.&nbsp; If you have been denied, you have certain rights and remedies but you must request an informal hearing immediately.&nbsp; This request must be in writing.

How is rent determined?

Rent, called the Total Tenant Payment (TTP), is based on your family's anticipated gross annual income minus deductions, if any.&nbsp; The HA may allow certain deductions for each dependent, or disabled or elderly family member.

The formula used in determining the TTP is the highest of the following:


	30 percent of the monthly adjusted income. (Monthly Adjusted Income is annual income less deductions allowed by the regulations);
	10 percent of monthly income;
	welfare rent, if applicable; or
	a minimum rent up to $50 set by the HA.


What is the role of the HA?

An HA is responsible for the management and operation of its local public housing program.&nbsp; An HA must (a) assure compliance with leases; (b) set other charges for security deposit, excess utility consumption, and damages to unit; (c) perform recertification of the family's income at least once every 12 months; (d) transfer families from one unit to another to correct over/under crowding, to repair or renovate a dwelling, or when a resident requests to be transferred; (e) terminate leases when necessary; and (f) maintain the development in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition.

How long can I stay in public housing?

In general, you may stay in public housing as long as you are eligible and comply with the lease.&nbsp; If, at recertification your family's income is sufficient to obtain private housing, the HA may determine whether your family should stay in public housing.

Section 8
Evictions",,Housing,"If you live in public housing or have a housing voucher, you have all the rights other tenants have and more.

If a Housing Authority (HA) seeks to evict you, it needs to have a good reason.&nbsp; The HA must prove you committed a serious violation of the lease.&nbsp; Or the HA must prove you committed repeated minor violations of the lease.&nbsp; Or the HA must have other ‘good cause.’&nbsp; You may be evicted from public housing for criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or peaceful enjoyment by other tenants.&nbsp; In addition, you may be evicted for drug-related activity at or away from your rental unit.&nbsp; The drug activity can be committed either by you, someone in your household, your guest or someone else in your control.

‘Good cause’ is usually defined as including, but is not limited to:


	Criminal activity or alcohol abuse
	Discovery of facts that made the tenant ineligible
	Discovery of false statements or fraud on the application or recertification
	Failure to comply with community service requirements (grounds for non-renewal of lease)
	Failure to accept a proper lease revision after 60 days notice.


Under most housing voucher programs, a private landlord may not evict a housing voucher tenant without ‘good cause.’&nbsp; In addition, a landlord cannot refuse to renew a lease without ‘good cause.’&nbsp;

A subsidized landlord can terminate a tenancy for:


	Material noncompliance with a rental agreement
	Material failure to carry out obligations under the landlord tenant law
	Drug-related criminal activity on or near the premises committed by you someone in your household, your guest or someone else in your control
	Illegal drug use or alcohol abuse by a tenant or household member
	Criminal activity committed by you, a household member, a guest or someone else in your control that threatens the health, safety or peaceful enjoyment of other residents
	Fleeing to avoid prosecution or jail or violation of parole
	Other good cause for which the landlord has given a warning that the action could lead to termination of the tenancy.


A landlord can evict for serious lease violations.&nbsp; A landlord can also evict for repeated minor violations.&nbsp; These violations must affect other tenants, project employees or the physical or financial security of the project.

Both a Housing Authority and private landlord may evict if you don’t pay your rent.&nbsp; Non-payment of rent is good cause for eviction.&nbsp; However, there may be reasons why a judge might not evict you.&nbsp; If household income is reduced, the HA must offer tenants a choice to pay income-based rent, a flat rent or a minimum rent.&nbsp; An HA must give 14 days’ notice to a tenant before termination for non-payment.&nbsp; Tenants cannot be evicted for non-payment of late fees or other extra charges.&nbsp; You can avoid eviction for non-payment by tendering rent before the actual eviction.

There are many defenses to eviction that tenants can raise.&nbsp; An eviction defense is a legal reason why you should not be evicted.&nbsp; When you go to court, tell the judge that you have a defense.&nbsp; If the judge agrees with you, you will not be evicted.

Here are some but not all of the eviction defenses that might stop your eviction:

General defenses to eviction:


	Your landlord did not give you a three-day Notice to Vacate (leave) before filing the eviction complaint against you.
	The three-day notice did not include this statement:
	""You are being asked to leave the premises. If you do not leave an eviction action may be initiated against you. If you are in doubt regarding your legal rights and obligations as a tenant, it is recommended that you seek legal assistance.""
	Your landlord gave you a three-day notice for non-payment of rent before the end of your grace period.
	Your landlord accepted rent from you after giving you a three-day notice.
	Your landlord often accepted late rent from you in the past but this time gave you an eviction notice because your rent was late.
	Your landlord accepted your partial rent payment but filed an eviction against you for not paying all the rent.
	You offered all of your rent to your landlord when it was due, but your landlord did not accept your rent.
	The person evicting you does not own the property and did not have an attorney fill out the eviction complaint.
	Your landlord is evicting you only because you complained about something the landlord should have done.


Defenses to eviction for tenants with Housing Vouchers:


	Your landlord’s Section 8 contract was cancelled by the HA, or the contract was abated after your unit failed inspections.
	Your landlord accepted money from the HA after giving you a three-day notice, or your landlord didn't send the HA a copy of the notice.

A mortgage for a home purchase, refinancing, or home equity loan is a product, just like a car.&nbsp; The price and terms may be negotiable.&nbsp; You'll want to compare all the costs involved in obtaining a mortgage.&nbsp; Shopping, comparing, and negotiating may save you thousands of dollars.

Obtain Information from Several Lenders&nbsp;

Home loans are available from several types of lenders: thrift institutions, commercial banks, mortgage companies and credit unions.&nbsp; Different lenders may quote you different prices.&nbsp; Contact several lenders to make sure you're getting the best price. You can also get a home loan through a mortgage broker.&nbsp; Brokers arrange transactions rather than lending money directly; they find a lender for you.&nbsp; A broker's access to several lenders can mean a wider selection of loan products and terms from which you can choose.&nbsp; They are not required to find the best deal for you unless they have contracted with you to act as your agent.&nbsp; You should consider contacting more than one broker, just as you should with banks or thrift institutions.

Whether you are dealing with a lender or a broker may not always be clear.&nbsp; Some financial institutions operate as both lenders and brokers.&nbsp; Most brokers' advertisements do not use the word ""broker.""&nbsp; Be sure to ask whether a broker is involved.&nbsp; This information is important because brokers are usually paid a fee for their services that may be in addition to the lender's origination or other fees.&nbsp; A broker's compensation may be in the form of ""points"" paid at closing or as an add-on to your interest rate, or both.&nbsp; Ask each broker you work with how he or she will be paid so that you can compare the different fees.&nbsp; Be prepared to negotiate with the brokers as well as the lenders.

Obtain All Important Cost Information

Be sure to get information about mortgages from several lenders or brokers.&nbsp; Know how much of a down payment you can afford.&nbsp; Find out all the costs involved in the loan. Knowing just the amount of the monthly payment or the interest rate is not enough.&nbsp; Ask for information about the same loan amount, loan term, and type of loan so that you can compare the information.&nbsp; The following information is important to get from each lender and broker:

Rates


	Ask each lender and broker for its current mortgage interest rates. Are they the lowest for that day or week?
	Ask whether the rate is fixed or adjustable.&nbsp; When interest rates for adjustable-rate loans go up, so does the monthly payment.
	If the rate quoted is for an adjustable-rate loan, ask how your rate and loan payment will vary, including whether your loan payment will be reduced when rates go down.
	Ask about the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).&nbsp; The APR takes into account not only the interest rate but also points, broker fees, and certain other credit charges that you may be required to pay, expressed as a yearly rate.


Points

Points are fees paid to the lender or broker for the loan.&nbsp; They are often linked to the interest rate.&nbsp; Usually the more points you pay, the lower the rate.


	Check your local newspaper for information about rates and points currently offered.
	Ask for points to be quoted to you as a dollar amount—rather than just as the number of points—so that you will actually know how much you will have to pay.


Fees

A home loan often involves many fees (loan origination or underwriting fees, broker fees, and transaction, settlement, and closing costs).&nbsp; Every lender or broker should be able to give you an estimate of its fees.&nbsp; Many of these fees are negotiable. Some fees are paid when you apply for a loan (such as application and appraisal fees) and others are paid at closing.&nbsp; In some cases, you can borrow the money needed to pay these fees but doing so will increase your loan amount and total costs. ""No cost"" loans may be available but they usually involve higher rates.


	Ask what each fee includes. Several items may be lumped into one fee.
	Ask for an explanation of any fee you do not understand.


Down Payments and Private Mortgage Insurance

&nbsp; Some lenders require 20 percent of the home's purchase price as a down payment.&nbsp; If a 20 percent down payment is not made, lenders usually require the home buyer to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) to protect the lender in case the home buyer fails to pay.

When government-assisted programs such as FHA (Federal Housing Administration), VA (Veterans Administration), or Rural Development Services are available, the down

payment requirements may be substantially smaller.


	Ask about the lender's requirements for a down payment, including what you need to do to verify that funds for your down payment are available.
	Ask your lender about special programs it may offer.
	If PMI is required for your loan,
	Ask what the total cost of the insurance will be.
	Ask how much your monthly payment will be when including the PMI premium.
	Ask how long you will be required to carry PMI.


Obtain the Best Deal That You Can

Once you know what each lender has to offer, negotiate for the best deal that you can. On any given day, lenders and brokers may offer different prices for the same loan terms to different consumers, even if those consumers have the same loan qualifications.&nbsp; Have the lender or broker write down all the costs associated with the loan.&nbsp; Then ask if the lender or broker will waive or reduce one or more of its fees or agree to a lower rate or fewer points.&nbsp; You'll want to make sure that the lender or broker is not agreeing to lower one fee while raising another or to lower the rate while raising points.&nbsp; There's no harm in asking lenders or brokers if they can give better terms than the original ones they quoted or than those you have found elsewhere.

Once you are satisfied with the terms you have negotiated, you may want to obtain a written lock-in from the lender or broker.&nbsp; A lock-in should include the agreed interest rate, the period the lock-in lasts, and the number of points to be paid.&nbsp; A fee may be charged for locking in the loan rate.&nbsp; This fee may be refundable at closing.&nbsp; Lock-ins can protect you from rate increases while your loan is being processed.&nbsp; If rates fall, however, you could end up with a less favorable rate.&nbsp; If that happens, try to negotiate a compromise with the lender or broker.

Remember: Shop, Compare, Negotiate

Shop around to compare costs and terms.&nbsp; Negotiate for the best deal.&nbsp; You can usually find information in your local newspaper and the Internet on interest rates and on points for several lenders.&nbsp; Since rates and points can change daily, check often when shopping for a home loan.&nbsp; But the newspaper does not list the fees, so be sure to ask the lenders about them.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to make lenders and brokers compete with each other for your business.

Warranty of Habitability
Other Landlord/Tenant
Warranty of Habitability",,Housing,"Escrowing Your Rent

As a tenant, the only time you do not have to pay rent to your landlord is when you pay it into escrow with the court.

You can escrow your rent if you believe that your landlord has violated any of his obligations that significantly affect health and safety,

For example if your landlord has not:

1. Made all repairs necessary to make the house or apartment livable;

2. Kept in good working order all electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilation systems;

3. Supplied hot water and heat at all times;

4. Kept hallways and stairways safe and sanitary;

Where to Start

1. You must be current with your rent before giving your landlord written notice of your intent to escrow the rent. If not, your landlord may try to evict you after he receives your notice. And the court may reject your Application to Escrow Rent (see below).

2. Before you can escrow your rent money with the Court, the law requires that you must first send your landlord WRITTEN notice of the violations to the place where you normally pay your rent.

Ask the post office to send it “certified mail, return receipt requested.” Always make a copy of the notice before you send it.

3. The notice you send must list the specific violations about which you are complaining. The letter must tell the landlord what needs to be fixed and what will be done if it’s not fixed, such as terminating your tenancy.

You must give your landlord 30 days to correct the violations unless the violation is a serious one, then the time period can be significantly shorter. For example: If the violation is “no heat in winter,” then 24-48 hours may be considered sufficient.

4. You must be sure that:

a. You are current with your rent;

b. The violations you are alleging are true and well documented with either witnesses or pictures; and

c. The violations are not caused by your own actions (such as failure to pay a heating bill).

If you don’t follow these steps, your landlord might be able to have you evicted. If you have followed these steps, then any attempt by the landlord to evict you may be considered “retaliatory.” You can present evidence of his attempts to retaliate against you to the Court.

If your landlord does try to retaliate against you, then the law may allow you to sue him for money and will allow any attorney who represents you to get attorney fees from the landlord.

Do not withhold rent to get your landlord to make repairs.

If That Fails

5. If the landlord has received your written notice and still fails to make the needed repairs, you can go to the Clerk of Courts for an Application to Escrow Rent.

Take your rent, the certified returned receipt and a copy of the written notice you have sent to the landlord with you.

6. There may be a filing fee.

After you have escrowed your rent, the clerk will notify the landlord. You can also file a written request with Clerk of Courts for the Judge to hold a hearing to order the landlord to make the repairs or to pay out of the money in escrow any person who does the repairs that the landlord will not do.

105,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/117,How to Get Your Security Deposit Back,Security and Damage Deposits,,Housing,"Suing Your Landlord in Small Claims Court: How to Get Your Security Deposit Back

Step 1:

Before you move out. Take pictures after you have cleaned and made repairs.&nbsp; Gather up the following things:

1) the full name, address, and telephone number of your landlord;

2) evidence to support your claim, including:


	a copy of your signed lease or rental agreement;
	any agreements with your landlord about security deposits; and
	photos you have taken of the rental unit;


3) the names and addresses of witnesses who are familiar with the rental unit.&nbsp; They should have seen it before you moved in and after you left;

4) copies of all letters you sent to your landlord about your security deposit;

5) cash or money order to pay the filing fee.

Step 2:&nbsp;

Take the items you have gathered to the Small Claims Division of the municipal or county court where your landlord lives or where the rental unit was located.

Step 3:&nbsp;

Ask the Clerk of Court how you can file a Small Claims lawsuit, the amount of the filing fee, and how you can get this fee back if you win the case.&nbsp; In most Small Claims Courts, the clerk will have you fill out a form called a “Small Claims Information Sheet.”&nbsp; Fill in the form completely and print neatly.&nbsp; You are the “Plaintiff” and your landlord is the “Defendant.”

Under the heading “Complaint,” write the following information:

1) My landlord is wrongfully withholding my security deposit.&nbsp; I am requesting “double damages” under Ohio Landlord/Tenant Law.

2) I moved out of the rental unit on _______________ and gave the keys to the landlord;

3) I gave the landlord an address where my security deposit could be sent.

4) My landlord should have returned the security deposit to me on ________.&nbsp; (This date is 30 days after you moved out and returned the keys);

5) My landlord has not returned any of my deposit despite my demands to do so.&nbsp; My landlord is ____ days late in returning my deposit

OR

6) My landlord has returned a portion of my deposit ($ _________) and refuses to return the remaining money despite my demand to do so;

7) My full deposit should be returned because:


	I paid my rent in full;
	I cleaned the rental unit and left it in satisfactory condition without damage or more than usual wear and tear (as clean, if not cleaner, than when I moved in)


8) Return the completed form to the Clerk of Court and pay the filing fee.

Step 4:&nbsp;

The Court will set a hearing date (usually several weeks after filing). Mark the date on your calendar.&nbsp; The Court will send your landlord a notice (summons) stating that he/she is being sued by you and the hearing date.&nbsp; Your landlord will have the chance to respond to your claims in writing.

Your Landlord’s Potential Responses:


	He/she may not respond at all in writing.
	He/she may file an “answer” to deny some or all of the information in your “complaint.”
	He/she may file a “counterclaim” against you if you have not paid all your rent or should pay more money because your security deposit did not cover the cost of cleaning and/or repairs.


Check with the court at least one day before the hearing to make sure that the summons was served.&nbsp; If it was not served, the Court will change the date of the trial.

Step 5:&nbsp;

Prepare for the hearing by doing the following things:

1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact your witnesses to make sure that they can come to court on the date of the hearing.

2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice what you plan to say at the hearing.&nbsp; A good way to present your case is to tell the judge what happened in the order of when it actually happened.&nbsp; You will only be given a few minutes to present your case. Keep it short and focus only on important things.

For example: “My landlord, Slick Susie, hasn’t returned my $750 security deposit and it has been almost two months since I moved out of her apartment at 1492 Dump Avenue. I have sent two letters to Slick Susie requesting that she return my deposit.&nbsp; She did not respond to these letters at all.&nbsp; State law says she is supposed to return my deposit within 30 days.&nbsp; She has not done so.&nbsp; When I moved out, the apartment was clean, nothing was damaged, and my rent was paid in full.”

Step 6:&nbsp;

Attend the Hearing.

106,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/118,Moving Out - Make Sure You Do What's Required,Security and Damage Deposits,,Housing,"When you move out you need to do what’s required so you can get your security deposit back.&nbsp; You are not responsible to fix “ordinary wear and tear.”&nbsp; You are responsible to fix damage you or your guests have caused.&nbsp; You are also responsible to clean excess dirt and return the unit to the condition it was in when you moved in.

It’s not always easy to decide what is “ordinary wear and tear” from what is your responsibility to clean. Examples are listed below:

Examples of Ordinary Wear and Tear Landlord Must Pay For:


	Curtains faded by sun
	Water-stained linoleum by shower
	Minor marks on or nicks in wall
	Light dirt or spotting on carpet
	Few small tack or nail holes in wall
	Rug worn thin by normal use
	Faded paint
	Dark patch of ingrained soil on wood floor


Examples of Damage Tenant Must Pay For:


	Cigarette burns on curtains or carpets&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Broken tiles in bathroom
	Large marks or holes in wall
	Door off its hinges
	Rips in carpet or stains from pets
	Lots of holes/gouges in walls
	Water damage on wall from hanging plant
	Water stains on wood floor caused by windows left open during rain


In general, keep these following things in mind:


	You should not be charged for damage present when you moved in.
	You should not be charged for replacement when repair would do.
	The longer you have lived in a place, the more wear and tear can be expected on things like carpets, floors, and walls.
	You should be charged a fair price for repairs and replacements.


To Avoid Problems, Follow These Cleaning Suggestions:

Kitchen


	Clean and defrost refrigerator and freezer
	Clean cupboards, sinks, tiles, woodwork and wall marks
	Clean stove, hood and filter (under burners, controls, burner rings &amp; drip pan)
	Clean oven and broiler
	Clean floor or, if carpeted, shampoo carpet


Living Room, Family Room and Bedroom


	Clean carpet and drapes
	Clean fingerprints off switches and walls
	Clean windows on inside


Bathrooms


	Clean tub, sink, toilet, and medicine cabinet; clean and wax floor, or if carpeted, shampoo carpet
	Clean cupboards, counter, woodwork and wall marks
	Clean windows on inside


Yard


	Mow lawn and remove trash


If you rented a furnished unit, polish furniture and spot clean upholstery.

To be sure you can prove that you cleaned you can take pictures or have a witness go through the unit with you.&nbsp; The best procedure would be to have the landlord walk through with you.

Your move out is final once you have returned the keys to the landlord and given an address in writing where your security deposit can be sent.

107,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/119,Security Deposits,Security and Damage Deposits,,Housing,"What is a Security Deposit?

A security deposit is money paid by a tenant to a landlord to cover expenses if a tenant later breaks the lease or damages the rental unit.&nbsp; When you move out, if you leave the unit in good condition and have paid the rent in full, your landlord must return the full amount of your security deposit.

Landlord’s Obligations with Regard to a Security Deposit

Within 30 days after the end of the lease and the time you move out (and return the keys to landlord), your landlord is required to do either of the following things:


	Return the full security deposit to you
	Explain in writing what your deposit was used for. For example, the written explanation might state: total of $50 withheld, $30 to spot clean living room carpet, and $20 to fix broken door.&nbsp; If your security deposit was $200, you should receive $150 back.


Tenant’s Obligations


	Give your landlord notice that you’re leaving.&nbsp; Check your lease for how much notice is required.&nbsp; Usually it’s 30 days if you pay rent monthly. If you give too little notice you may have to pay another month’s rent.
	Give your landlord a forwarding address in writing where you can receive mail.
	Clean the apartment and return the keys to your landlord.


When Can My Landlord Legally Keep Part of My Security Deposit?

1. If you left the unit dirty or damaged, your landlord may deduct from your deposit the cost of any cleaning or repairs needed. Your landlord may not use your security deposit to fix “ordinary wear and tear.”


	You should not be charged for damage present when you moved in.
	You should not be charged for replacement when a repair would do.
	The longer you have lived in a place, the more wear and tear can be expected on things like carpets, floors, and walls.
	You should be charged a fair price for repairs and replacements.


2. If you left the apartment without paying all the rent due, your landlord may deduct from your deposit the amount of any unpaid rent or utility charges you were responsible for under the lease.&nbsp; This unpaid rent claim usually happens in one of the following ways:&nbsp;


	You are behind on the rent; you give notice of your intent to leave and leave as planned.&nbsp; Your landlord can deduct what you owe for past rent..
	You give notice of your intent to leave and stay longer than you planned. Your landlord can deduct from your security deposit to pay for the additional days you stayed.
	You lease your unit on a month-to-month basis and leave as planned, but you give too little notice of your intent to leave (usually 30 days).&nbsp; Your landlord can deduct an additional month’s rent from your security deposit.


What Can I Do If My Landlord Does Not Refund the Security Deposit and Does Not Send a Written Explanation About Why My Money Was Not Returned?

Write your landlord a letter asking for return of your deposit and a written explanation why any of your deposit is not being returned and what it is being used to pay for.&nbsp; Include an address where your deposit can be sent.&nbsp; Send the letter to your landlord by certified mail and request a return receipt.&nbsp; Keep a copy of the letter and the receipt showing the letter was delivered to your landlord.&nbsp; This is important to prove you sent the letter and your landlord received it.&nbsp; You can fill in the blanks on the sample letter contained in this packet or write your own.

If your landlord does not respond, write a second letter demanding return of the full deposit and threatening to file a lawsuit in small claims court if you do not receive the money by a certain date.&nbsp; You can fill in the blanks on the sample letter contained in this packet or write your own.&nbsp; If your landlord still does not return your deposit, you can file in small claims court.

What If My Landlord Doesn’t Have Good Reason to Keep My Security Deposit?

After you receive the written explanation from your landlord, write your landlord to state why you think certain deductions should not have been made.&nbsp; Ask for that money back.&nbsp; Send the letter to your landlord by certified mail and request a return receipt.&nbsp; Keep a copy of the letter and the receipt showing the letter was delivered to your landlord.&nbsp; You can fill in the blanks on the sample letters contained in this packet or write your own.

Letter to Landlord: Notice of Forwarding Address for Return of Security Deposit

Letter to Landlord: Second Request for Return of Security Deposit

If your landlord does not respond to this request or refuses to refund any of your deposit, you can file a lawsuit in small claims court.

Evictions
Tenant Rights",,Housing,"First Cause: Eviction:

The first cause is the eviction part of an eviction case. The landlord is asking the court to force a tenant to move.

Second Cause: Money:

The second cause is the money part of an eviction case. The landlord wants money for unpaid rent or damage the tenant has caused. Not all cases have a second cause. Although the first and second causes are filed together, there are separate hearings for each.

Notice to Leave (AKA 3 Day Notice)

The landlord must give you a written notice to leave the premises at least three days before filing an eviction case in court. This comes from the landlord, not the court.

Notice to Terminate Tenancy (AKA 30 Day Notice)

In a month to month tenancy, either the landlord or the tenant can serve on the other a Notice to Terminate the Tenancy. No reason need be provided for the termination. If a tenant stays beyond 30 days, the tenant is a “holdover tenant” and will likely be evicted. The landlord still must serve a “Notice to Leave” before filing an eviction.

Forcible Entry and Detainer

The legal term for “eviction.” Also called an F.E.D.”

Clerk of Courts

The Clerk of Courts is the office that keeps all court documents.

Complaint

The legal paper filed with the clerk of courts to start a lawsuit.

Summons

The summons is the official notice of your court date. An eviction summons may come in the mail, be attached to your door, or be handed to you in person. It will include a copy of the complaint.

Plaintiff

The person who files a lawsuit. For evictions, the landlord is the Plaintiff.

Defendant

The person who is being sued. The tenant is a defendant in an eviction.

Magistrate

The magistrate is the person who hears eviction cases.

Answer

The answer is the tenant’s response to the claims in the complaint.

Counterclaim

Counterclaims are the tenant’s claims for money from the landlord.

Continuance

A continuance is the postponement of a court date.

Set-Out

The “Set-Out” is the physical eviction. The bailiff forces the tenant to leave and all of the tenant’s belongings are moved to the sidewalk.

Bailiff

The bailiff is the court official who is must be present when there is a physical set-out.

Writ

The writ is the court order to have a court official physically remove (“evict”) a tenant.

Default Judgment

A default judgment is like forfeiting a ball game. You lose because you did not file an answer or did not show up in court.

109,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/121,Overview of Eviction Process,"Evictions
Evictions
Evictions",,Housing,"There are two basic parts to most eviction cases:

1. The first part (referred to as the “first cause”) is the actual eviction suit. In this suit, your landlord claims you no longer have the right to stay in the rented home and requests a court order to force you to leave.

2. The second part (referred to as the “second cause”) is your landlord’s attempt to sue you for money. In this suit, your landlord claims you owe money - usually for things such as: back rent (rent you failed to pay in the past), back utilities (utilities bills you failed to pay), or damage you caused to the home. Your landlord requests a court order giving him/her the right to collect money from you.

• To find the amount of money your landlord is asking for, look in the Complaint he/she filed against you.

Although both the first and second causes are filed together (in one complaint) and have the same case number, they are treated as separate cases. Two different hearings will be held, one to determine whether or not you should be evicted and another to determine if you owe money to your landlord and if so, how much.

WHAT DO I DO WHEN I RECEIVE A COMPLAINT FOR EVICTION AND MONEY DAMAGES?

If you do not think you owe your landlord money or you disagree with the amount of money he/she claims you owe, you MUST file what is called an “Answer”. An answer is your written response to your landlord’s claim that you owe money. If you do not file an answer, you will automatically lose (your landlord will get a default judgement).&nbsp; There will be no hearing if you do not file an answer.

If you feel your landlord actually owes you money, you should file an “Answer and Counterclaim”. A counterclaim states your claims against your landlord and explains why your landlord owes you money. In a counterclaim you are actually suing your landlord. &nbsp;There is a filing fee due to the court when you file a counterclaim.

TIMING IS IMPORTANT:

Your “Answer” or “Answer and Counterclaim” must be filed with the court within 28 days of the date you received the eviction summons and complaint.&nbsp; If you don’t file within this time period, your landlord will get a judgment against you for the amount of rent he/she claims you owe and court costs.&nbsp; You will also lose the opportunity to sue for the money you think your landlord owes you.

Your landlord has 14 days to reply (answer) to your counterclaims. If the landlord does not reply, then you can ask for a default judgement (order in your favor because the other side did not respond as required or failed to show up in court) against your landlord.

STEPS TO FILING ANSWER OR ANSWER &amp; COUNTERCLAIM:

1. Decide which you will file, the Answer or Answer and Counterclaim.

ANSWER: If you only wish to dispute the fact that you owe money to your landlord or the amount of money he/she claims you owe, you want to file an answer.

The answer states:

• A denial that you owe part or all of the money your landlord claims you owe;

• A request that your landlord return your security deposit, plus interest;

• A general denial that you owe the money is sufficient

ANSWER &amp; COUNTERCLAIM:

If there are reasons why your landlord actually owes you money then you want to file an Answer and Counterclaim.

Possible reasons why your landlord could owe you money include:

• You overpaid on rent,

• Your landlord will not return your security deposit,

• You made improvements/repairs to the apartment,

• You or a family member suffered an injury because of something that is the landlord’s fault

2. Calculate when you must file your Answer or Answer &amp; Counterclaim. You have 28 days from the date you received the court papers (summons &amp; complaint) to file your papers. If the last day of the 28 day period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or national holiday, you have until the next business day to file. If you do not remember when you received your papers, call the Clerk of Courts office at the court where your case was filed - give them your case number and tell them you need the date you were “served”.

3. Complete the necessary paperwork.

What do I say in the answer?

Deny any part of the complaint you believe to be untrue. (If you do not deny something, the court will assume it is true and you will not be given a chance to deny it at the hearing.)&nbsp; State your counterclaims (if any). To do this, simply describe why your landlord owes you money and how much you believe you are owed.

At the end, tell the Court what you want it to do.

• If you have no counterclaims, you want the court to dismiss the case and require your landlord to pay court costs.

• If you have counterclaims, write the amount you want the court to award you.

TIPS:

• You (the tenant) are the Defendant and your landlord is the Plaintiff.

• The Case No. is listed on the top, right-hand side of the Complaint you received.

4. Make three copies of the completed paperwork and take the original and copies to the Clerk of Court’s office to file. The clerk will time-stamp all of the copies, take the original and return the copies to you.

It will not cost you any money to file an Answer, but the court may have a charge for filing an Answer &amp; Counterclaim. You should call the clerk’s office to check on the cost of filing a Counterclaim. You must bring the money with you or the Clerk will not let you file your documents.

Keep one copy of the time-stamped documents for yourself and give the other to the person who signed the complaint (your landlord or your landlord’s lawyer). If your landlord has an attorney, it MUST go to the attorney.&nbsp; If no attorney, then to the landlord.&nbsp; You can send this copy by regular U.S. mail or hand deliver it to your landlord/landlord’s attorney.

5. After filing you Answer or Answer &amp; Counterclaim, the court will send you a notice of the time and place of your trial. The trial will usually be held 2 to 3 weeks after the case is filed. You must appear on time for the trial or the court will dismiss your case and the landlord will get everything he/she asked for in the complaint.

What to Bring With You to Court:

1. “Physical documents” relevant to your counterclaims such as: rent receipts, security deposit receipts, utility receipts, lease or rental agreement, letters written between you and your landlord, and any receipts you may have for supplies you used to make repairs. Bring the originals and photocopies.

2. Photographs relevant to your counterclaims, such as photos of the conditions of your apartment or repairs that need to be made.

3. Witnesses who have actually seen the things or actually heard the conversations that you are testifying about at trial.

a. Be prepared to testify on your own behalf.

b. Be prepared to ask your landlord yes/no questions.&nbsp; (This is called cross-examination)

I FILED AN ANSWER OR ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM, NOW WHAT HAPPENS?

1. An eviction hearing will be held. At this hearing the judge/magistrate will only decide whether or not you should be evicted.

First, your landlord will be given a chance to argue his/her side. He or she will try to prove to the court that:

• Your lease was up or you broke the lease.

• A 3 day notice to leave was served.

• No rent was accepted from you after the notice was served.

• You are still living in the rental home.&nbsp; When your landlord is finished, you will be given a change to argue your side.&nbsp; Explain to the court why you should not be evicted. To prove your case, you can show the judge or magistrate a copy of the lease or rent receipts, question the landlord or the landlord’s witnesses, and explain to the court what happened.

CAUTION:

It is hard to stop an eviction when you have not paid rent, even if you think you have a good excuse for failing to pay.

Proving the following facts might help your case:


	your landlord did not give you Notice to Leave the Premises,
	you have a rent receipt to prove that you did pay rent,
	your landlord accepted rent after serving the Notice to Leave the Premises,
	The 3 day notice did not have the required language in it
	your landlord has always accepted your rent late and surprised you by refusing it this time,
	you offered rent on time, but your landlord refused to take it,
	you paid you rent in escrow to the Clerk of Courts because of bad conditions in your apartment.


Last, the magistrate will make a decision regarding the eviction.

• If your landlord wins:

The court will grant the landlord a “writ of restitution.”&nbsp; By executing the writ, the court will schedule a “set-out date” with the bailiff’s office.&nbsp; The “set-out date” will be anywhere between 3-10 days, on average, you will have about a week to vacate the unit, or your belongings will be set-out by the Bailiff.

• If you win

The first cause will be thrown out and you will have the right to continue living at the rental space as a tenant.

2. No matter who won the first cause (eviction), if your landlord requested money damages AND you filed an Answer or Answer and Counterclaim, a hearing will be scheduled on the second cause. You will be informed of the date.

However, if you did not file an Answer, there will not be a second hearing and you will automatically lose.&nbsp; This is called a default judgment. The Court will issue an order requiring you to pay money damages your landlord requested and you will not be given an opportunity to argue that this amount is incorrect, plus court costs and interest.

If a hearing is scheduled, bring evidence and witnesses with you to this hearing to prove that your landlord owes you money, and you do not owe him/her money.

For example:

If you are arguing that bad conditions in the home made it worth less than your rent, bring photos or these bad conditions or witnesses who have seen these conditions and can explain them to the Court.

If you are arguing that you paid too much rent for one month and your landlord owes you a refund of the amount overpaid, show the court the cancelled check for this overpaid amount or a copy of a rent receipt for that month.

If you cannot file your Answer and Counterclaim within the 28 days, ask for an extension, called a Leave to Plead, for more time to file your answer.&nbsp; The Leave must be filed within the 28-day period.&nbsp; Your Answer and Counterclaim must be filed by the end of the extension.

If you do not file your Answer and Counterclaim on time, the landlord or his attorney will seek a default judgment against you.&nbsp; A default judgment is a decision by the court in favor of the landlord, usually whatever the landlord requested.&nbsp; The landlord will then seek to collect from you.

The Answer and/or Counterclaim

The landlord’s claim will state that you owe money for back rent, back utilities or damages to his property.&nbsp; These ‘money damages’ will be listed in the Complaint he filed against you.&nbsp; This is called a Second Cause of Action.

In your answer, tell the court why you don’t owe all the money.&nbsp; If there are reasons why the landlord owes you money, that is what you state in your Counterclaim.

Your ANSWER will generally contain the following information:


	A statement that you admit or deny that you owe money the landlord claims.
	A request for return of any security deposit plus interest that the landlord still has.&nbsp; (State the amount of the security deposit then write, “plus interest”).
	If the landlord demands late charges which are unjustified (the charge is more than any damage the landlord has suffered by your late payment), then state that the late charges are unconscionable.
	If the landlord demands attorney fees, state that the law does not allow for attorney fees in an eviction case.


Your COUNTERCLAIM may include things such as:


	The landlord’s failure to do those things he is required to do as a landlord.
	Any Improvements or repairs that you made.
	Any personal injury to you or a family member due to the landlord’s fault. NOTE: Any claim you have involving a personal injury to you or a family member should first be looked at by a lawyer.
	The amount of your security deposit plus interest.
	How much less in rent the apartment was worth because the landlord failed to keep any oral or written promises to make repairs or improvements.
	The amount of damage you suffered because the landlord failed to do what he said he would in your written lease.
	Any other reason you should receive money from the landlord.


For each of the above claims in your counterclaim, you must state the amount of money your claim is worth.&nbsp; When deciding upon an amount, be reasonable, but try not to state an amount that is too small when considering the damage you suffered.

Preparing For the Trial

After you have filed your Answer and Counterclaim, the court will send you a notice of the time and place of your trial.&nbsp; You must appear on time for the trial or the court will dismiss your case against the landlord and give the landlord a default judgment.&nbsp; If the landlord does not show up at the trial, ask the court to dismiss his case against you.&nbsp; Then proceed with your case against the landlord.

Subpoenaing witnesses:

&nbsp; A subpoena is a court order that the person has come to court.&nbsp; Don’t subpoena anyone who will hurt your case.&nbsp; To have them bring documents in their possession, describe in your subpoena what you want them to bring to court.&nbsp; Ask the clerk to give you a subpoena duces tecum for this.&nbsp; Obtain subpoenas at the Clerk of Courts in the court where your case was filed.

If the Health Department has been out to the unit, call and ask the investigator what the problems were and whether repairs have been completed.&nbsp; Get his/her name and subpoena him/her for the trial.&nbsp; In your subpoena, tell them to bring the Health Department file for that unit—state the exact address.&nbsp; If you know the approximate date of their investigation, list that on the subpoena.

You should take the original documents with you to court, along with some extra photocopies.&nbsp; The court will keep a copy for its file.

Getting a Lawyer to Represent You

It is always best to be represented by a lawyer.&nbsp; There are ways to prepare for trial or negotiate a settlement that are not discussed here.&nbsp; For some types of claims against a landlord, the law may allow for your attorney fees to be paid by the landlord.

112,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/127,Homeowner's Checklist for Avoiding Foreclosure,"Foreclosure
Foreclosure",,Housing,"Before Trouble Starts:

Start a file, in a safe place, for records relating to your home


	Purchase and sale agreement
	Mortgage application
	Closing documents
	Property tax bills
	Property insurance information
	Letters you receive from and copies of letters you mail to the bank


Use checks or money orders to pay bills


	Do not send cash
	Do not use credit cards
	Keep a record of all payments (date paid and check number)
	Correct errors quickly


Pay high priority bills first


	Food
	Mortgage
	Utilities (heat, hot water, electricity, gas)
	Do not pay credit cards or other unsecured debts before your mortgage


When Things Start To Feel Tight:

Where is the money going?


	Create a budget that shows your current in come and expenses
	Review every item on your budget
	Prepare a realistic budget that you can live with until your circumstances improve


Increase your income


	Collect federal and state benefits if you are eligible (check with a Benefits Bank)
	Claim the earned income tax credit (EITC) if you are eligible
	Stop all voluntary deductions being taken out of your paycheck
	Consider selling unnecessary property to raise money


Reduce your expenses

Review every expense for potential savings—reduce or eliminate unnecessary expenses


	Pay only for the type of phone service you need
	Cancel cable television service temporarily
	Identify ways to conserve on energy and other utilities
	Participate in a home weatherization program
	Review your homeowner's and auto insurance policies and shop around.
	Claim the owner-occupant property tax exemption and others for which you are eligible


Other Considerations


	Contact your mortgage servicer at the first sign of trouble
	Ask your utility company for budget billing so you can pay the same amount each month If you are behind on your utility bills, start an affordable repayment plan


After Falling Behind:

Identify the problem


	What caused your current situation (job loss, illness, divorce, decreased income)
	How long do you expect your difficulty to last
	What specific type of help do you need
	How much can you afford to pay toward your mortgage


Communicate

Speak with your lender’s delinquent loan or loss mitigation specialist


	Explain your situation
	Ask for a mortgage workout package
	Keep a phone log that shows the date and time of your call, who you spoke to, the person’s phone number, and what was said
	Follow up your phone call with a letter and keep a copy for yourself
	Send all letters by certified mail and keep the receipt


Pay what you can and save the rest


	Send to the lender as much of the mortgage payment as possible
	If the lender returns your payment, save the money in a separate account and do not spend it on other bills
	Continue to make monthly payments into the separate account if the lender refuses to accept your payments


Know Your Options:

There are many ways the lender can help you if you fall behind on your mortgage. Which one you choose/need and what the lender allows will depend on your individual situation.

Reinstatement:

You give the lender all of the back payments you owe and start making your regular monthly payment. With a partial reinstatement you pay at least one-half of the back payments first and agree to a repayment plan for the rest of what you owe.

Repayment Plan:

You make the regular mortgage payment plus an additional amount toward the back-payments until you are caught up (usually no longer than 12 months). If the lender sets up a repayment plan for you, make sure it is reasonable. Do not agree to a plan that will not work for you.

Forbearance:

The lender agrees that for a limited period of time it will accept a lower monthly payment or no monthly payment. At the end of the forbearance agreement you must bring the account current.

Modification:

The lender agrees to change one or more terms of the mortgage. Possible changes include: reducing the interest rate; extending the term of the mortgage; and adding the arrears to the unpaid principal balance of your loan.

Short Sale:

The lender may let you sell the home even if you owe more than the property is worth and agree to accept the lesser amount as payment in full. You must have a buyer and a signed purchase and sale agreement. Anyone else who has a lien on the property and the private mortgage insurer, if there is one, must also agree to the short sale.

Refinance:

You take out a new mortgage to pay off the old mortgage. Sometimes it makes sense to refinance. You should contact a legitimate lender and proceed carefully. Beware of large fees and high interest rates.

Deed in Lieu:

You cannot afford to keep the home and you give the house back to the lender. Do not ask for a deed in lieu when you have equity in the property or when a short sale is possible. The lender will not accept a deed in lieu if there are other mortgages or liens on the property.

Other Things to Know:

Talk to a lawyer or HUD certified housing counselor experienced in default and delinquency counseling

Foreclosures move very quickly.

Foreclosures are public: Avoid Rescue Scams!

Where to go for help:


	Your local non-profit housing organization
	Your mortgage company
	The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at www.hud.gov. Or call HUD at 1-800-569- 4287

113,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/128,Foreclosure Timeline,"Foreclosure
Foreclosure",,Housing,"Day 1:

You fail to pay the mortgage payment by the due date, the first of the month.

Day 16-30:

Late charges are assessed on the payment. The mortgage servicer attempts to make contact with you to find out what happened.

Day 45-60:

The servicer sends you a “demand” letter because you failed to pay. The servicer has the right to demand the entire amount of the loan.

Day 90:

The servicer refers the loan to the foreclosure department and hires an attorney to start foreclosure proceedings.

The servicer then files the legal documents at the Court of Common Pleas. This is called a “complaint.” Once the case is filed, the court will send you a copy of the complaint by certified mail and/or through delivery by a sheriff’s deputy.

What happens next depends on what, if any, action you take. If you do nothing, the process may move swiftly. The servicer may file a motion with the Court for a ""default judgment."" This could happen one month after you receive court papers. The court may give the servicer a judgment quickly, setting up the house for a sheriff’s sale.

If you take action in response to the complaint, you must do so within 28 days. An attorney can help you through this process.

Day 150+:

Once a court grants a judgment to foreclose, the sheriff will appraise the value of your house. Following the appraisal, the sheriff will schedule a sale and advertise the sale in the local newspaper for at least three weeks. The sale is a public sale which is held at a designated area either in the court house or at the sheriff’s office. Again, this may happen sooner or later, because times are only approximate. The property must sell for at least two-thirds of its appraised value. This is not the same as what you owe or the original purchase price. The sheriff will report the results of the sale to the court. The loan servicer will then ask the court to confirm the sale. This means the court will approve the sale, order a new deed for the buyer and distribute the money from the sale. There may still be a chance to save your home. Contact a housing counselor immediately.

After the Sale:

You have the right to buy back your home before the sale is confirmed. This ""right to redeem the property"" allows you to pay the amount you owe against the house in full. You will also owe any additional fees and costs incurred as a result of the foreclosure. Typically, it will take 30 days to ""confirm"" the sheriff’s sale.

After Confirmation:

You will be given a notice by the sheriff to leave. The amount of time varies by county. Call your local sheriff to check or to try to negotiate for more time.&nbsp;

Stark County

On Thursday, April 21, Community Legal Aid Services, Inc. held its “Spring 2016 Justice for All Event” at the Cultural Center for the Arts in Canton.&nbsp; The event honored a community partner, two volunteer attorneys, and two staff members who have done exemplary work in promoting equal justice in Stark County.

Community Award

At the event, Stark County Job and Family Services received the Community Award, which recognizes an agency that has partnered with Legal Aid in an effort to promote safety, health, stability, and economic security in the community.&nbsp; Through their partnership, Legal Aid and SCJFS have been able to provide services that enable their clients to achieve self-sufficiency.&nbsp;These effective services include a coordinated referral system for clients&nbsp;seeking better employment opportunities by the sealing of criminal records, engaging fathers with their&nbsp;children, responsibly promoting parental rights and obligations and diligently working with the&nbsp;marginalized to navigate the public benefits system.&nbsp;

Mayor Thomas Bernabei of Canton presented the award to Robert Pierson, Deputy Director for Child Support.

Pro Bono Award

Alex Robertson, Attorney at Law, and Jeremy Foltz, Attorney at Law, were both recognized with the Pro Bono Award, which honors an attorney who has made a significant contribution to Legal Aid’s Volunteer Legal Services Program.&nbsp; These attorneys dedicate hours of free time to working with clients who would otherwise be unable to afford such assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr. Robertson is a private attorney from Alliance, OH.&nbsp; He has volunteered in over thirty of Legal Aid’s Consumer Debt Clinics since 2013. &nbsp;Individuals who are being sued on a&nbsp;credit card action have benefited immensely from his knowledge and expertise in this&nbsp;area in what is surely a&nbsp;a financially stressful and difficult time. He goes out of his way to&nbsp;explain the process to his clients and make sure that they understands their rights and&nbsp;responsibilities.

Mr. Foltz is a family law attorney from Plain Township and a Magistrate for the Canton Municipal Court. He has represented low income clients in over fifty cases since he began volunteering for Legal Aid in 2009. &nbsp;Mr. Foltz regularly (and willingly) takes cases that have been described as ""outside of the box,"" those which involve intricate legal issues and often require a great time commitment. &nbsp;In addition to these cases, Jeremy also volunteers with the reduced fee divorce program and pro se clinics.

The Pro Bono Awards were presented by Judge John W. Wise of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Employee Recognition Award

Employee Recognition Awards were given to Paralegals Kelley Molla and Cheryl Steele for their passion and commitment to Legal Aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Kelley Molla has been with Legal Aid since 1991, first working as a receptionist and then as a VLSP paralegal with the Legal Assistance to Victims team, where she is dedicated to working towards keeping women and children safe. Her passion for this work extends beyond Legal Aid, as she is involved with the Stark County Domestic Violence Collaborative and the Victim’s Rights Coalition. Kelley is a life long resident of Canton and a graduate of Timken High School.&nbsp;

Cheryl Steele has been with Legal Aid for over 28 years, joing the Stark County Legal Aid Society in 1988. Prior to that, she worked at the Stark County Clerk of Court’s Office and for private firms. Cheryl has worked in various capacities at the Canton office, including in payroll and on housing the team. She is currently a VLSP paralegal on the Access to Justice Team, and is glad to make a difference in lives of the clients that she assists, especially at custody and pro se divorce clinics. Cheryl previously served as an officer on the Northeast Area Renaissance (NEAR) Board.

The awards were presented by Nancy Grim, President of Legal Aid’s Board of Trustees.

Advance Directives
Living Wills
Powers of Attorney",,Powers of attorney / advance directives,"What is a living will?

A living will is a legal document which states your wishes about life-sustaining treatment if you become terminally ill or permanently unconscious.&nbsp; It is different from a health care power of attorney. A living will:


	only becomes effective if you can’t communicate your wishes and are permanently unconscious or terminally ill;
	states whether you want life-support to be used;
	gives doctors the authority to follow your instructions about medical treatment;
	can be changed or revoked by you at any time;
	cannot be changed or revoked by anyone else;
	will be followed for a pregnant woman only if certain conditions apply; and
	specifies under what conditions you would want artificial feeding and fluids to be withheld.


If my living will says I don't want to be hooked up to life-support, would I still get pain medication?

Yes. A living will only affects care that artificially postpones death. Medical care to ease pain and comfort care are never limited. This could include oxygen, pain medication and personal care, such as would be received in a hospice.

Can I specify that I don’t want CPR or other extraordinary measures?

Yes. The standard living will form allows you to direct your physician to write a DNR (do not resuscitate) order. Two doctors must have agreed that you are either terminally ill or permanently unconscious and that it is medically appropriate.

Can I have a document telling my doctor that I want all treatment to be continued using every available means to keep me alive?

Yes. Don’t use the standard forms. Talk with your attorney.

Who decides that I am dying or permanently unconscious without hope of recovery?

If you haven’t signed a living will, your family and doctors won’t know your wishes. Most likely medical treatment will continue even if there’s no hope of recovery. If you have signed a living will, two doctors who have examined you must agree that you are beyond any medical help and that you will not recover.

Who should have a living will?

Everyone. Disease and accidents can strike at any age.

Would my family be notified before doctors stop life-support treatments?

Doctors must make reasonable efforts to notify the person you named in your living will or a family member, before following your instructions to withdraw life-support. If the person notified feels your living will is not being properly followed, an immediate hearing can be scheduled in probate court. The court would decide if there is a legal reason why your instructions should not be followed. By law, no one can change or overrule your living will if it was freely and correctly executed.

Can I have a feeding or fluid tube removed?

Yes. If you want to allow your doctor to withhold artificial nutrition or hydration should you become permanently unconscious, you must state this in your living will. You do not need to give any special instructions to allow your doctor to withhold nutrition and hydration if you are in a terminal condition and these efforts do not provide comfort or pain relief.

If I don’t have a living will, can the person I name in my health care power of attorney make end-of-life decisions for me?

Yes. You need to state this in your health care power of attorney. A living will can spell out end-of-life instructions. Or you can give your agent in a health care power of attorney the power to make all health care decisions.

What is a health care power of attorney?

A health care power of attorney is a legal document that gives another person the right to make health care decisions for you if you cannot make them for yourself. It is sometimes called a ""durable power of attorney for health care"" or ""DPOA."" A&nbsp; health care power of attorney


	allows you to chose a person you trust to make health care decisions for you anytime you cannot make them yourself;
	becomes effective only when you cannot make your own health care decisions;
	requires the person you appoint to make decisions based on your wishes; and
	requires the person you appoint to make decisions based on your living will if you have both documents.


Do I have to choose a family member as my health care power of attorney?

No. You can appoint any adult. It’s best to choose someone who is more likely to be available when you need them. However, you cannot appoint your doctor, your health care facility (nursing home or hospital) administrator or their employees.

Do I need both a living will and a health care power of attorney?

It’s best to have both. A living will only applies in limited end-of-life circumstances. A health care power of attorney covers all other times when you cannot make health care decisions for yourself.

What is a mental health declaration?

The standard health care power of attorney addresses both physical and mental health issues. In certain situations, it may be advisable to have a ""declaration of mental health treatment"" also.&nbsp; For more information, see the Ohio Legal Rights Service website at www.olrs.ohio.gov Type ""declaration of mental health treatment document"" in the search box.&nbsp; See www.olrs.ohio.gov/sites/olrs.ohio.gov/files/u5/MHDeclare.pdf.

My parent gave me a health care power of attorney before going into a nursing home. Can I act make decisions on her behalf? You can make decisions once your parent is no longer able to make them.

A health care power of attorney covers all aspects of medical treatment whenever a patient is unable to make their wishes known.

Can I use a health care power of attorney to take care of my parent’s financial matters?

No. A mentally competent adult can sign a power of attorney or durable power of attorney to allow you to help with financial affairs. If your parent didn’t sign a durable power of attorney and is not now mentally competent, you must to seek guardianship.

Where can I find the standard forms for a living will and health care power of attorney?

The forms are available from attorneys, your doctor and other organizations. Or mail a request with $3 to the Midwest Care Alliance, 855 South Wall Street, Columbus, OH 43206. Or get them on-line at www.ohpco.org.

What do I do after I fill out these documents?

Make several copies. Give one to a trusted family member and the person named in the document. Keep one with your personal papers. Give copies to your doctor and your lawyer.

126,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/149,Power of Attorney: What is it? Should I have one?,"Powers of attorney/advance directives/living wills
Wills/Estates",,Powers of attorney / advance directives,"Power of Attorney

One of the most helpful, yet dangerous, legal documents that an older person can sign is a Power of Attorney. This brochure helps answer some of the questions you should ask before you sign a Power of Attorney.

1. What is a Power of Attorney?

It’s a legal document that gives someone else the right to do things for you, in your name, as if you were doing them yourself. The person who gives the power is called the “principal.” The person who gets the power is called the “attorney in fact” or “agent.”

2. What can an agent do in my name?

An agent can do whatever the Power of Attorney allows. It can be quite limited or very broad. If you are interested in having your agent only handle certain financial matters for you, your Power of Attorney can limit what the agent may do. Some powers of attorney let the agent do just about anything. This is usual with pre-printed forms.

3. What are the risks in signing a Power of Attorney?

If a Power of Attorney gives an agent unlimited rights, the agent will have complete access to all the principal’s assets including bank accounts, safe deposit boxes and real estate. If the agent is honest, there will be no problem. If the agent uses the assets unwisely, or for his or her own benefit, the principal may lose them. If that happens, it is unlikely that the agent can be made to repay the lost assets. In other words, the agent can take all of your money and sell your house out from under you. The more you own, the more you can lose.

If you have any doubts about the person you plan to name as your agent, you could seek conservatorship in Probate Court. The court oversees the handling of your property by a conservator with limited powers who in unlikely to steal your assets.

4. What can I do so my agent won’t cheat me?

The most important thing is to choose an agent that you can really trust. If you think there’s any possibility that the agent wants to control your assets for his or her own purposes, don’t make him or her your agent.

Consider other ways of doing what you think you need an agent to do. For example, make arrangements for direct-depositing checks into your account. You may want someone else to have access to your checking account to pay bills. (If you put someone else’s name on your account, you make them a co-owner.) Sign a power of attorney designating an agent for your checking account only. Ask your bank to move enough money every month from your savings account to your checking account to cover your usual debts.

5. What about real estate?

If you think you may own real estate at a time when you may not be able to manage it, then a Power of Attorney can allow someone else to manage the property for you. In fact, without a Power of Attorney, it will be impossible for someone to sell or manage your property without a court order.

6. I know a trust-worthy person and want to make a Power of Attorney. Now what should I do?

Ask the person whether he or she is willing to take on the responsibility you wish to give. If not, plan to name someone else you trust.

Think carefully about what powers you want your agent to have. Make sure that the document you sign will give the agent only those powers, and nothing more, and that it also has the other features you want.

A pre-printed form or one provided by a person who wants to be your agent can get you into trouble. If there is anything in the document that you don’t understand, DON’T SIGN IT. Review it with someone you trust who does understand it and can explain all of its provisions to you. Even better, take it to a lawyer who will look out for your best interests.

7. What else should be in the Power of Attorney?

The law gives a principal some very important choices. Normally a Power of Attorney becomes void when you become disabled, incapacitated, or if a court finds you incompetent. If you want your agent to handle things for you if you become disabled, then you will want to sign a Durable Power of Attorney which remains valid if you become disabled. You should also be aware that all Powers of Attorney automatically end when the principal dies.

Ordinarily, a Power of Attorney becomes effective immediately. You may want it to become effective if and when you become disabled or as of some specific date. You can state this in the Power of Attorney. It “springs” into effect at the time you designate. For most people who are still able to handle their own affairs, a ‘springing’ Durable Power of Attorney is the best choice.

8. Signing the Power of Attorney

Although a Power of Attorney may be “legal” when only the principal signs it, most banks and other institutions will not honor it unless it is witnessed and/or notarized.

9. What if I change my mind after I sign?

You may revoke a Power of Attorney at any time, as long as it doesn’t prohibit revocation. But you will still be bound by anything your agent has done before you revoked. File any revocation with the County Recorder. Give copies to the agent and financial or other institutions with which the agent has been doing business on your behalf.

10. What if I need to become someone else’s agent?

A Power of Attorney is not valid unless the principal is mentally competent when it is signed. The principal must understand what he or she is signing and the effect of it. If someone who is not legally competent appoints you as agent, you may face personal liability if anyone later challenges your actions. If possible, discuss the matter before your loved one loses the ability to understand. If that’s impossible, and there’s no other way to do what needs to be done, you may have to apply to become guardian.

What are adult protective services?

Adult protective services are services that help vulnerable adults age 60 and older who are in danger of harm, are

unable to protect themselves, and may have no one to assist them. The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) administers the state’s Adult Protective Services program. The agency has the authority to plan and develop programs and write rules and regulations pertaining to adult protective services. It also provides technical assistance to county staff. The county departments of job and family services receive and investigate reports of abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable adults and evaluate the need for protective services.

What types of things are considered abuse?

Abuse is the infliction upon an adult (by one’s self or others) of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation or

cruel punishment with resulting physical harm, pain or mental anguish. Maltreatment includes neglect, exploitation, and physical, emotional and sexual abuse.

Neglect

Is the failure of an adult to provide the goods or services necessary for his or her own safety and/or well-being, such as avoiding physical harm, mental anguish or mental illness, or the failure of a caretaker to provide such goods or services.

Exploitation

Is the unlawful or improper act of a caretaker using an adult or his/her resources for monetary or personal benefit, profit or gain.

Physical abuse

Includes pushing, hitting, slapping, pinching and other ways of physically harming a person. It can also mean placing an individual in incorrect positions, force feeding, restraining or giving medication without their knowledge.

Emotional abuse

Occurs when an elderly person is threatened, humiliated, intimidated or otherwise psychologically&nbsp; hurt.

Sexual abuse

Includes rape or other unwanted sexual contact, but it can also mean forced or coerced nudity, exhibitionism, and other non-touching sexual situations.

What is the best way to report suspected abuse or neglect of an adult?

To make a report of abuse or neglect, contact the law enforcement agency or the county department of job and

family services in the county where the adult resides or where the incident occurred. To find the phone number

Social Security
Eligibility
Retirement Benefits
Survivor Benefits",,Social Security,"What are the different types of social security?

The Social Security Administration has two basic programs. One program is the Retirement, Survivors, Disability Insurance (RSDI) program. This program provides benefits to workers with sufficient work history. The other is the Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) program. This program provides benefits to aged, blind and disabled individuals.

RSDI: SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT:

This program provides a cash benefit for a retired worker, spouse and minor children. Social Security benefits are based on the worker’s earnings over a lifetime.

The social security retirement age is changing. Early retirement is at age 62. Full retirement is at age 65. If you were born between January 2, 1943 and January 1, 1955 your full retirement age is 66. Early retirement benefit checks are significantly lower. Be sure you know your options before retiring. Check the SSA on-line retirement estimator.

Spouses or divorced surviving spouses

Of retired workers a may collect a benefit check. The check is one-half of the worker’s check. The spouse or divorced surviving spouse must be:


	age 62 or older or caring for a child under the age of 16; and
	not eligible for benefits under their own social security earnings.
	A divorced spouse must have been married to the retired worker over 10 years and not be remarried.


Spouses or divorced surviving spouses

May have been in the paid labor force. They will receive a benefit based on their own record. Their benefits are based on their own record only if their benefit is more than 50% of the retired worker’s benefit.

Some workers receive pensions based on federal, state or local government employment. These workers may not have been covered by social security. Any social security benefit payable to them may be reduced. This is called the government pension offset program. This rule does not apply to persons entitled to social security benefits before 1978. Other rules apply. For more information, contact your union representative or the Social Security Administration.

A widow or divorced widow may continue to collect a benefit check. This check will be in the full amount of the worker’s benefit check. Remarriage will not affect the check if the widow is over age 60. A totally and permanently disabled widow can receive benefits at age 50. A divorced widow must have been married to the deceased worker for 10 years or more and not be remarried.

A disabled divorced spouse may collect a benefit check at age 50 or older. The disabled divorced spouse must be totally and permanently disabled. He or she must have been married to the retired worker for 10 years and not remarried.

RSDI: SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY:

This program provides a cash benefit for a disabled worker, spouse and minor children. Social Security benefits are based on an individual’s average lifetime earnings.

Spouses of disabled workers

May collect a benefit check in the amount of one-half of the worker’s check if caring for a child under the age of 16.

Any unmarried children of the disabled worker may also collect a benefit check up to age 18. Benefits continue to age 19 for full time students.

An unmarried disabled child of an insured worker may receive a benefit check. They must apply before age 22.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI):

The SSI program provides a cash benefit for adults with limited or no work records. The adult may have worked only a short time. Or the worker may not have worked in covered employment. SSI benefits are available to aged, blind and disabled individuals. Household income must be below the poverty level.

Disabled minor children may also be eligible for an SSI check. Their household income must be below the poverty level. A spouse or children of an SSI recipient cannot receive benefits unless they are individually eligible.

In 2012, an adult can receive both an SSI check and either a social security disability or social security retirement benefits. Their monthly benefit must be below $698 per month. The individual must also meet certain asset limits.

Contact your local Social Security Administration office for more information. Call the toll free number below. Check their website at ssa.gov.

1-800-772-1213 is an automated telephone service. It has recorded information. You can conduct some business 24 hours a day. You can speak to a Social Security representative between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. Generally, you’ll have a shorter wait time if you call during the week after Tuesday.

42,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/44,Earned Income Tax Credit,Taxes,,Taxation,"What Is The Earned Income Tax Credit?

The EITC is a tax benefit for working people who earn low or moderate incomes.

When you file a tax return, you may get a refund of federal taxes withheld. If you qualify, you may also get an additional cash refund, known as EITC.

How Much EITC Cash Can You Receive?


	Single or married people WITHOUT CHILDREN may get up to $496&nbsp;if your income is less than $14,590 if single, or $20,020 if married; OR,
	If you have ONE CHILD, you may get up to $3,305&nbsp;if your family income is less than $38,511 if single or $43,941 if married; OR,
	If you have TWO CHILDREN, you may get up to $5,460 if your family income is less than $43,756 if single or $49,186 if married.
	If you have THREE OR MORE CHILDREN, you may get up to $6,143&nbsp;if your family income is less than $46,997 if single or $52,427 if married.


Who May Get EITC?

Any person who worked full-time or part-time during the year, and meets the following guidelines:
You Must Have Earned Income
Earned income is...


	income from wages, tips and self-employment
	includes long-term disability payments paid by the employer until you reach the minimum retirement age.


Earned income is NOT…


	unemployment benefits, child support, Social Security benefits, pensions, retirement benefits, workers compensation benefits, alimony, welfare benefits, food stamps, job training benefits, and interest.
	payments received from a disability insurance policy for which you paid the premiums.


You&nbsp; Must File Single, “Married Filing Jointly” or “Head of Household”


	You cannot file “married filing separately.”


You Cannot Have Investment Income


	Investment income is interest, dividends, and rental income from personal property of more than $3,350.


You Must Be A US Citizen or Resident Alien


	You are a resident alien if you have a “green card” or if you meet a residency requirement.
	Nonresident aliens cannot claim EITC.


You May Be Eligible For More Money If You Have A Qualifying Child


	A qualifying child includes your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, great-grandchild, or eligible foster child.
	Brothers, sisters, step-siblings, as well as their descendants, are also qualifying children if they were cared for as members of the family.
	A foster child may be eligible.
	At the end of the tax year, your qualifying child must be under age 19 or a full-time student under age 24.
	To be a full-time student, the child must be enrolled in school full-time for five months of the year.
	A totally and permanently disabled child of any age also may be a qualifying child.
	Your qualifying child must live with you in the United States for more than half the year.
	In most cases, you do not have to claim your child as a dependent in order to qualify for EITC.


If You Have No Qualifying Child Then You Must Be Over The Age of 25 And Under Age 65.

You Must Have A Valid Social Security Number

Both you and your spouse must have valid Social Security Number(s).
Any child you claim for EITC (qualifying child) must also have a valid Social Security Number.&nbsp; However, if you had a child that was born and died during the tax year, you do not need a Social Security Number for that child.
You can file an amended tax return to claim the EITC for prior years when you did not have a Social Security Number.

What If My Child Is The Qualifying Child of Someone Else?


	Someone else, such as your mother or father, may be able to claim your child for EITC purposes.
	Generally, when two people qualify to claim the same child for EITC purposes, you and the other person can decide who will claim the child.&nbsp; However, if you CANNOT agree, the claim of the child’s parent takes precedence.
	This rule may not apply to all cases.&nbsp; You should consult with a tax advisor to find out if you can claim the child for EITC purposes.


Other Issues and Questions

Special Rules for Military Personnel


	Nontaxable Combat Pay – You may elect to have your nontaxable combat pay included in your earned income.&nbsp; If you choose to include your nontaxable combat pay in your earned income, you MUST include all of the nontaxable combat pay you received.
	Military Personnel Stationed Outside of the U.S. – If you are stationed outside of the U.S. for extended active duty, then you are considered to have lived in the U.S. for that duty period.


Will EITC Affect My Public Benefits?
EITC will not affect your eligibility for certain benefits, such as food stamps, low-income housing, welfare and SSI.&nbsp; However, if the EITC you receive is not spent within a certain period of time, it may count as an asset or resource and affect your eligibility for these benefits.

If you are denied public benefits or your amount decreases because of the EITC, you should call Community Legal Aid Services, Inc.

What If The IRS Denies My EITC Claim?
If you think that you qualify for EITC and the IRS denies your claim, contact Community Legal Aid Services, Inc. for assistance.&nbsp; An appeal to the IRS explaining why you are qualified to claim EITC must be filed and documents that support your claim must be attached.

If you do not appeal the IRS decision, you may not be able to claim EITC for the next two years.&nbsp; If the IRS determines that you fraudulently claimed EITC, you may not be able to claim EITC for the next 10 years! You must file Form 8862 with your tax return if the IRS previously denied your EITC.

	Steer clear of companies that promise you instant money or a down payment for a car, furniture or jewelry if you let them file your income tax return.&nbsp; What may look like a great deal could cost you much of your refund.
	Don’t be fooled by flashy ads or TV commercials.&nbsp; Instead of the instant refund or down payment offered, you get a very expensive Refund Anticipation Loan that could cost you more than a 200% annual interest rate.&nbsp; It pays to wait for the IRS to give you your check.
	If your return is prepared incorrectly and you do not receive the refund you anticipate, you will still owe the credit company for the loan made to you — and you could also OWE THE IRS!


Slavery Reparations - Don’t be a Victim of the Reparations Scam

There is no tax law that provides African-Americans tax credits or refunds related to slavery reparations.


	Don’t be tricked into filing slavery reparations claims.&nbsp; The only persons profiting from filing such claims are the promoters.
	If you allow such a claim to be filed in your name, you could be fined $500 by the IRS, especially if you refuse to withdraw the claim or file more than one claim.
	If you pay someone to file a federal income tax return to get reparations, you will lose what you paid and you will get NO REFUND!

Guidelines for finding a reputable tax preparer:


	Permanent Office:&nbsp; Select a preparer who has a permanent office and will be available if your tax return is audited.&nbsp; Check out the preparer with the Better Business Bureau.
	Properly Trained:&nbsp; Select a preparer who is properly trained.&nbsp; Ask how recently the preparer took tax classes.
	Accurate Return:&nbsp; Avoid anyone who suggests that you lie or “fudge” figures.&nbsp; You will be responsible for the errors or lies—not the preparer. Anyone who promises you a bigger refund without knowing your tax situation could be misleading you.&nbsp; Make sure the preparer signs your completed return.&nbsp; Sign your return only after you look it over to make sure it is honest and correct.&nbsp; Don’t sign a blank tax return form or one done in pencil.
	Reasonable Fee:&nbsp; Ask how much the preparer charges and whether there are extra costs for additional forms or schedules before hiring the preparer.
	No Loan Solicitation:&nbsp; Do not consider a “refund anticipation loan” because the cost is too high.


Keep a copy of your return and proof that you submitted it to the IRS.

The Child Tax Credit is a tax benefit for people with low or moderate incomes.

The Child Tax Credit may reduce the taxes you owe and in some cases may give you a cash refund.

Is the Child Tax Credit Like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)?

The Child Tax Credit is not the same as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Child Tax Credit and EITC have different rules.

Many people who do not qualify for the EITC, qualify for the Child Tax Credit. Some people will qualify for both the Child Tax Credit and the EITC.

A married couple with two children will qualify for the EITC if their combined incomes are below $46,044. A married couple with two children will qualify for the full Child Tax Credit if their combined incomes are less than $110,000!

Unlike the EITC, you can:


	Get more Child Tax Credit if you have more than two children;
	Claim the Child Tax Credit and file as “married filing separately”;
	Claim the Child Tax Credit with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).


Who Can Get the Child Tax Credit?

To get the Child Tax Credit, your child must be:


	Your son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, adopted child, grandchild or eligible foster child.
	Under age 17 at the end of 2011. Your child must be 16 years old or younger on December 31, 2011.
	Your dependent. Your child must qualify as a dependent and be listed on your tax return as a dependent.
	A citizen or United States (U.S.) resident. You can be a U.S. resident even if you do not have permission to live and work in the U.S.


**You must also earn more than $3,000 per year to qualify for the Child Tax Credit.

How Much Child Tax Credit Can I Get?

The amount of your Child Tax Credit depends on the number of children that you have. You can get up to $1,000 per qualifying child.


	
		
			Number of Children
			Maximum Child Tax Credit
		
	
	
		
			1
			$1,000
		
		
			2
			$2,000
		
		
			3
			$3,000
		
		
			4
			$4,000
		
	


To get the maximum amount, you must make less than or equal to the income listed.


	
		
			Filing Status
			Amount
		
	
	
		
			Married Filing Jointly
			$110,000
		
		
			Married Filing Separately
			$55,000
		
		
			Head of Household and Qualifying Widow
			$75,000
		
		
			Single
			$75,000
		
	


Will the Child Tax Credit Affect My Public Benefits?

The Child Tax Credit will not affect your eligibility or amount of most public benefits, even if you receive a cash refund of the Child Tax Credit.

If you already get assistance, the Child Tax Credit should not affect the amount of your benefits.

If you are denied public benefits or your amount decreases because of the Child Tax Credit, you should call Community Legal Aid’s Legal HelpLine.

For More Information

To find out how much Child Tax Credit you can get, you should:


	Talk to a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance(VITA) Volunteer 1-800-829-1040 (for the location of a VITA site)- or -
	Talk to a Tax Counselor for the Elderly (TCE) or AARP Volunteer 1-888-227-7669 (for the location of a TCE site)- or -
	Talk to a tax professional


More information can be found in IRS Publication 972. You can obtain a copy of the publication on the IRS website www.irs.gov or by calling 1-800-829-3676.

Additional Child Tax Credit

The Additional Child Tax Credit is a refundable credit and may give you a refund even if you do not owe any tax.

Will I Get a Cash Refund of the Additional Child Tax Credit?

You might get a cash refund of the Additional Child Tax Credit if you did not use all of your allowed Child Tax Credit listed on your tax return.

To calculate the cash refund of the additional child tax credit, see IRS Publication 972 and IRS Form 8812.

45,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/47,Hardship Status,Taxes,,Taxation,"What Is Hardship Status?

Hardship status or Currently Not Collectible status is a possible option for taxpayers who have difficulty meeting basic living expenses and cannot enter into an installment agreement or who do not qualify for an offer in compromise.&nbsp;
Hardship status does NOT remove or eliminate the tax debt owed.&nbsp; It does place the collection process “on hold”.&nbsp; The tax is still owed and interest and penalties still apply.&nbsp; The IRS will cease all collection efforts and will release all levies from wages.

Who Qualifies for Hardship Status?

Taxpayers who cannot afford to pay the IRS without suffering a financial hardship.&nbsp;

What are my obligations while on Hardship status?

You need to file all future tax returns on time.
You need to pay all taxes on those tax returns.

How Long Can I Stay in Hardship Status?

As long as your financial situation does not change, you should remain in hardship status until the time period for the IRS collect the tax expires.
You will be removed from hardship status if your financial situation improves so you are no longer qualified for hardship status.&nbsp; While in hardship status, the IRS will send you an annual statement showing the amount of tax still owed and the amount to be paid when the taxpayer is in a better financial situation.&nbsp;

What is the time period for the IRS to collect on tax debts?

The IRS has ten years from the date the taxes are assessed to collect taxes owed.&nbsp; Certain events can extend this time period to collect the tax. &nbsp;Once the time period to collect the tax has expired, then the IRS will never be able to collect on the debt, and you will no longer need to be in hardship status.&nbsp;

Do I need to reapply every year to stay on hardship status?

No, once you are placed into hardship status you can remain there unless your financial situation changes.&nbsp; For example, a large increase in income could cause you to no longer qualify.&nbsp;

Do interest and penalties continue to add to my debt? 

Yes.&nbsp; While the IRS cannot collect when you are in hardship status, interest and penalties will continue to be applied to your debt.&nbsp;

Do I need to file my taxes?

Yes.&nbsp; You need to continue to file timely tax returns while on hardship status.&nbsp; You also may need to file tax returns for previous years.&nbsp;

Can I still receive my tax refunds or stimulus money?

No, the IRS will collect that money and apply it towards your debt.

If Community Legal Aid Services represents me, what documents will they need to put me in hardship status?

The Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) gives low-income wage earners free legal assistance on federal tax matters.

&nbsp;

We never charge a fee for our services. &nbsp;You may have to pay court costs and filing fees.

&nbsp;

We are independent of the Internal Revenue Service and the Ohio Department of Taxation. &nbsp;All telephone conversations and client interviews are confidential.

&nbsp;

Most low-income taxpayers are honest and want to comply with the tax laws. &nbsp;Some tax laws change each year and some tax laws are hard to understand. &nbsp;If you have a problem with the IRS, you might need legal assistance.

Who We Serve

The LITC serves low-income taxpayers who have disputes with the IRS.

&nbsp;

The LITC can serve taxpayers for whom English is a second language.

&nbsp;

The LITC helps taxpayers who do not already have representation in their case and who cannot afford to pay for legal representation or tax assistance. &nbsp;We will not handle cases with more than $50,000 in dispute.

&nbsp;

In determining eligibility, we evaluate each taxpayer’s situation individually. &nbsp;Among the factors we consider are:


	
	Whether English is a second language
	
	
	Current income and income on the return
	
	
	Domestic violence
	
	
	Physical or mental disability
	
	
	Number of family members
	
	
	Nature and complexity of the tax issue
	


Types of Cases We Handle

Liens and Levies

Have you received a notice that the IRS plans to file a lien on your property for past taxes, or a notice that it will levy on your property or garnish your wages? &nbsp;We may be able to STOP the levy and place your case in hardship status.

Negotiations and/or Settlements of Tax Debt


	
	Are you unable to pay your tax debt? &nbsp;We may be able to help you with the following options:
	
	
	Enter into an installment or payment agreement
	
	
	Stop collection activity if it would be a hardship to pay the tax debt
	
	
	Place your account in currently not collectible status
	
	
	Make an offer in compromise (settlement) which settles your debt for less than the amount owed
	


Innocent Spouse Relief Requests

Have you received a bill from the IRS for taxes on a joint tax return? &nbsp;Do you believe it would be unfair to hold you responsible for these taxes? &nbsp;Depending on your circumstances, your knowledge of the debt, current marital status, and other factors, you may qualify for relief as an innocent spouse.

&nbsp;

We may be able to help you apply for innocent spouse relief or assist you if the IRS has denied this relief.

Injured Spouse Claims

Have your taxes been withheld to pay a debt your spouse had before you married, such as a tax debt or a defaulted student loan, or a recent child support or federal debt? &nbsp;If you filed a joint return, and you had your own income and tax payments on the tax return (tax withholdings or earned income tax credit), you may have some relief. &nbsp;The spouse who did not owe the debt may request his or her portion of the tax refund.

&nbsp;

The Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic may be able to help you file the injured spouse claim and assist you if the IRS denies this claim.

&nbsp;

Audits or Examinations

Have you received a letter from the IRS telling you that your tax return is being audited or examined? &nbsp;The letter may say that the IRS is reviewing your filing status, such as head of household, or certain claimed deductions or credits (dependency exemptions, business deductions, earned income tax credit, child tax credit or child care credit).

&nbsp;

We may be able to prepare evidence requested by the auditor, file a request to reconsider, attend meetings with IRS employees on your behalf, or represent you during an audit.

&nbsp;

Earned Income Tax Credit Appeals

The IRS audits many earned income tax credit (EITC) returns. &nbsp;Have you received a letter from the IRS that your earned income tax credit has been denied?

&nbsp;

If the IRS determines that the error was reckless or intentional, you cannot claim the EITC for the next two years. &nbsp;If the IRS finds that the error was fraud, you cannot claim the EITC for the next ten years. &nbsp;We may be able to help you appeal the EITC denial to keep your right to claim the EITC in the future.

Deficiency Notices

Have you received a notice from the IRS that there is a “deficiency” in your taxes and that you have 90 days to file a petition to the Tax Court? &nbsp;If you do not file within that time, you lose the right to go to court without first paying the tax. &nbsp;We may be able to help you settle the matter or file a petition to Tax Court

Employee/Independent Contractor Disputes

Do you have a dispute about whether you are an employee or an independent contractor? &nbsp;You may owe a lot of self-employment taxes. We may be able to help you ask the IRS to change your employment status.

Other Things We Do


	
	Speak to groups such as social service agencies, churches, groups that work with immigrants, spouse abuse shelters, school-based family centers, and others.
	
	
	Prepare pamphlets about taxpayer rights and responsibilities.

138,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/168,The Truth About Refund Anticipation Loans,Taxes,,Taxation,"The “Tax Refund” That Really Isn’t One: The Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL)

How would you like to pay a super-high price to borrow money that already belongs to you? Sounds ridiculous, right? But that’s pretty much what happens to many folks at tax time in the crazy world of RALs or refund anticipation loans.

You may be tempted by tax-time advertisements for “Fast Cash Refunds, “Express Money,” or “Instant Refunds.” These ads will offer to get you your refund in just a day or two, or even on the spot. Beware! Many of these “fast refunds” are really LOANS, refund anticipation loans.

When you get a RAL, you’re borrowing against your own tax refund money. RALs are often marketed to people who need money the most — low– and moderate-income workers who receive the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Don’t Pay Triple-Digit Interest Rates to Borrow Your Own Refund

RALs are extremely expensive. In 2002, the average taxpayer paid about $75 in RAL fees, which translates into an Annual Percentage Rate of 143.6%. You’re lining someone else’s pockets with YOUR hard-earned money just to get your refund a few days earlier than you can for free from the IRS!

RAL fees, combined with tax preparation, electronic filing and other fees, can end up eating away a big chunk of your refund.

If your RAL is directly deposited onto a prepaid credit card, it is likely that you will be charged an initial fee, a fee for point-of-sale transactions, an ATM fee and an “inactivity” fee in addition to the fees paid for the RAL.

RALs Can Be Hazardous to Your Financial Health

In addition to their high costs, RALs can be risky. Since a RAL is a loan from a bank in partnership with a tax preparer, it must be repaid even if the IRS denies or delays your refund, or your refund is smaller than expected. If you don’t pay back the RAL, the lender will take actions to hurt your credit rating and may send your account to a debt collector. In addition, when you apply for a RAL, you are giving the lender the right to grab your tax refund to pay for old tax loan debts that the lender claims you owe.

Ways to Save At Tax Time

Here are ways to take a pass on that RAL– most folks don’t need one—and save money at tax time:

E-File with Direct Deposit –

File your tax return electronically (E-file) to speed up your refund. Tell the IRS to deposit the refund directly into your bank account—by providing your account number right on your tax return. You can get a refund in about 10 days this way—without paying one cent extra for a loan. Some of the free tax preparation programs (called VITA or TCE sites) can file taxes electronically. If you have internet access, you may be able to get free tax preparation and free electronic filing at www.irs.gov/efile

Get a bank account –

If you don’t have a bank account, open one up to take advantage of direct deposit. Use a savings account to receive your tax refund, and maybe save some of it for a down payment on a house or a car, or to build a nest egg.

Wait just a bit longer –

Do you really have to get cash from your tax refund today? Can you wait a few weeks to save more than $100? If you have an urgent bill to pay, ask for more time until the tax refund check comes from the IRS. Don’t take on a new debt to pay an old bill.

Avoid check cashers –

Check cashers charge an extra fee to cash RAL and tax refund checks. Some check cashers charge up to 7% to cash a RAL check—the average is about 3%. So if you receive a $2,000 refund, it would cost you and average of $60 to cash the RAL check—on top of the RAL and tax preparation fees. A smarter move is to use a bank account.

Contact the Taxpayer Advocate Service –

If you are suffering an economic hardship and need your refund quickly, the Taxpayer Advocate Service may be able to assist you. Call 1-877-777-4778.

Beware of Unnecessary Financial Products

In addition to RALs, tax preparers and their bank partners offer another high cost tax refund product that is often called a “Refund Anticipation Check” or “Refund Transfer.” While this product is not a loan for the amount of the expected refund, it is a high cost financial product in which you pay a substantial fee (approximately $28) for the privilege of a temporary bank account into which the IRS direct deposits the refund check. After the direct deposit of your refund, the bank issues you a paper check and closes the account.

Buyer BEWARE! Even Retail Businesses Want a Piece of Your Refund

Tax time is also a boom time for used car dealers, who take advantage of “instant” tax refunds for use as down payments on vehicles. Dealerships use service providers that will prepare and file your tax return, and arrange for a refund anticipation loan through a bank. The dealer uses the RAL check as the down payment. You could pay fees that range from $150 to $200.

Rent-to-own stores have also found a way to benefit at tax time by offering “instant” tax refunds and RALs to their customers. The store gives the customer a stored value card which can be used almost anywhere that accepts MasterCard, as well as to gain access to cash at select ATM’s. An incentive, such as a coupon for two weeks of free rental of an item at a rent-to-own store when you pay for any new rental with the CashCard, may be offered.

EXAMPLE*

For a tax refund of $2,000, you might pay to get a RAL:

RAL loan fee: $75

Electronic filing fee: $40

Document Preparation or “Application/Handling” fee: $33

Tax preparation fee: $100

TOTAL: $248

This is OVER 10% of your refund!

*Amounts are based on reported charges for 2002

121,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/143,Financial Responsibility Requirements,Drivers License,,Traffic,"Drivers and vehicle owners are required to have insurance. Or they must have another means of covering personal injury or damage. The law requires coverage in minimum amounts: $12,500 for bodily injury to one person in an accident; $25,000 for bodily injury to more than one person in an accident; and $7,500 for property damage.

Drivers are required to have proof of financial responsibility. Law enforcement will ask to see proof. If you cannot provide proof immediately, you will be cited. You may lose your license. If you do not have insurance, you will be required to prove to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) that you are financially responsible. You can do that by obtaining one of the following types of insurance:


	Certificate of Insurance (Form SR22) from a licensed insurance agency; or
	Surety Bond in the amount of $32,500 from a licensed insurance agency; or
	BMV Certificate for money or government bonds in the amount of $30,000 on deposit with the State of Ohio Treasurer.


The insurance must be maintained for three years from the suspension date. BMV may require 5 years if there is a history of failure to maintain insurance cases and for certain convictions.

Drivers can face license suspension for many reasons. You may face suspension because you couldn’t immediately prove you had insurance. If so, you can request a hearing.

RANDOM SCREENING

If you can’t show proof of financial responsibility you will lose your license and registration for a minimum of 90 days. The length of the suspension is:


	90 days for a first offense;
	one year for a second offense involving an incident or offense in which insurance was required but was not in effect; and
	two years for third or later offenses within a five-year period.


To regain your license and registration, you must:


	Serve out the suspension time;
	File and maintain Financial Responsibility Insurance (Form SR-22 or Bond) for three years on a first offense, and five years on a second or later offense;
	Pay a Reinstatement Fee.
	Pay a $50 surrender fee. If the BMV receives your registration, license plates and driver license before the suspension starts, this fee may be deducted from the amount owed. There is no fee reduction if your license was expired or revoked or you never had a license.


The BMV destroys all driver licenses and license plates it receives. You must buy a new driver license and license plates after all requirements are met.

The BMV can issue registration privileges and new license plates before the end date of the suspension if the fees are paid and Financial Responsibility Insurance is filed.

Any driver or owner may request an Administrative Hearing (see below) before the suspension takes effect or at any time during the suspension period.

For additional information concerning exemptions, inoperable or seasonal vehicles, contact the BMV Columbus Office at (614) 752-7700.

SECURITY SUSPENSION

A Security Suspension can happen following an accident if property damage is more than $400.00. Or if a personal injury claim is filed in a State Crash Report. Security suspensions are limited to two years from the date of an accident. An uninsured motorist must meet one of the following requirements:


	Send a release signed by all parties showing the damages have been paid in full; or
	Send a notarized installment agreement signed by all parties showing payment arrangements have been made. (If payments are not made, there is two year suspension. You must show a full release or a deposit for the remaining balance.); or
	Deposit the amount of damages with the BMV. $500.00 is the minimum for personal injury. BMV will hold the deposit for two years from the date of accident. The injured party may file in court. If the BMV receives a court order, it will send the deposit to the court. If no court action is taken, the BMV will return the money to you at the end of the two year time; or
	File for Bankruptcy and include this claim. Send your Discharge to BMV.


Any driver or owner facing a Security Suspension can request an Administrative Hearing.

REQUESTING A HEARING

You can request a hearing at any time after you receive the ""First Notice of Suspension."" You must request the hearing in writing. Send the request to the address listed on the suspension notice. Send a $30 check or money order for the hearing fee payable to ""Treasurer, State of Ohio."" You must send the fee with the hearing request. The fee will be refunded if your suspension is overturned. The purpose of the hearing is to decide whether:


	you had financial responsibility; or
	you meet one of the exemptions.

124,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/146,Driver's License Suspensions: Limited Driving Privileges,Drivers License,,Traffic,"Learn more about your driver’s license suspension.&nbsp; Get a copy of your unofficial driving record from the Ohio BMV website at www.ohiobmv.com .

Not everyone is eligible for Limited Driving Privileges (LDP).&nbsp; First, the type of suspension must allow for LDP.&nbsp; Below are some of the most frequent types of suspensions:

12 Point Suspension


	The suspension is for six months starting on the 20th day after the notice was mailed.
	The suspension can be appealed if there is a good reason to not suspend driving privileges. The appeal should be filed before the suspension starts.


The reinstatement requirements are:


	Complete a remedial driving instruction course given by an accredited remedial school.
	Prove financial responsibility though filing an SR 22 or bond.
	Retake a complete driver license examination.
	Pay a reinstatement fee to the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles.


Child Support Suspension


	The Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) can order an indefinite suspension if a driver has not paid child support as ordered or ignored a warrant or subpoena.
	A driver with this suspension is NOT eligible for LDP.


The reinstatement requirements are:


	Satisfy CSEA requirements.&nbsp; Contact the CSEA directly.
	CSEA will notify the BMV to release the suspension.
	Pay a reinstatement fee to the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles.


Court Suspension


	The court decides the length of this suspension.
	A driver can apply for LDP through the court.
	A reinstatement fee is required for suspensions over 89 days


Failure to File Crash Report Suspension

BMV will issue this suspension if:


	a driver is involved in an accident;
	personal injury or property damage over $400.00 occurred; and
	a State Crash Report is not filed.
	A driver with this suspension is NOT eligible for LDP.


The reinstatement requirements are:


	File a State Crash Report, BMV 3303 with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles.


Judgment Suspension

A person injured or who has property damage from someone else’s motor vehicle may sue the driver or owner.&nbsp; The injured person may request the BMV to suspend driving and registration privileges if a judgment from the lawsuit has not been paid for over 30 days.

This judgment suspension is indefinite unless the defendant obtains one of the following:


	A full release or agreement signed by the plaintiff or plaintiff’s attorney ;
	A certified court order showing a full release or agreement;
	A bankruptcy listing the judgment.
	The driver must file proof of financial responsibility (Form SR-22 or Bond) for three years from the suspension date.
	BMV may issue a Noncompliance Suspension. This will not happen if the driver has already been suspended for the same accident.


License/Bond Forfeiture Suspension

This suspension occurs when a driver:


	is charged with a first, second, third or fourth degree misdemeanor;
	fails to appear in court, pleads guilty or is found guilty; and
	fails to pay the fine.


The driver’s license and vehicle registration are suspended indefinitely.

The reinstatement requirements are:


	the driver must appear in court and pay a fine;
	pay the original fine;
	pay a reinstatement fee.


Non-Compliance Suspension


	Any driver or owner who fails to show proof of financial responsibility will lose driving and registration privileges for a minimum of 90 days.&nbsp; Longer suspensions can occur for a second offense in five years.
	Registration and license plates may be impounded if the driver owns the vehicle.


To regain driving privileges and registration, the driver or owner must:


	Serve out the suspension time;
	File proof of financial responsibility for three years for a first offense and five years for a second offense;
	Pay a reinstatement fee.
	The driver may be required to pay a surrender fee.
	Registration privileges and duplicate license plates may be issued before the end of the suspension if the fees are paid and proof of financial responsibility is filed.


Warrant Block

Note this is not a suspension.


	The BMV will deny the person named in the block the right to apply for a license or registration.
	The court must notify the BMV that all outstanding arrest warrants have been satisfied.
	The person must pay a reinstatement fee.


To obtain limited driving privileges, a driver must:


	have a valid driver’s license,
	have proof of financial responsibility,
	be eligible for privileges (this depends on the type of suspension), and
	need privileges for occupational, educational, vocational, or medical purposes.


A court may not grant limited driving privileges during any suspension imposed by the BMV unless authorized by law.

Call Community Legal Aid Services (CLAS) after you meet the requirements to obtain limited driving privileges.&nbsp; You will be required to fax a copy of all documents to CLAS.&nbsp; CLAS must determine if you qualify for services.&nbsp; If so, pleadings will be sent to you for filing on your own.&nbsp; You must represent yourself at court hearings.

102,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/114,Transfer on Death Affidavit,Wills/Estates,,Wills / Estates,"What is a Transfer on Death Deed (TODD)?

A “Transfer on Death Deed” is a deed in which the owner of property designates one or more beneficiaries who receive the property at the death of the owner. No new Transfer on Death Deeds are being created at this time. They remain valid to transfer property to beneficiaries.

What is a Transfer on Death Affidavit (TODA)?

A “Transfer on Death Affidavit” is the new method of transferring property outside a will. The owner of property designates a beneficiary who receives the property at the death of the owner.

What are the benefits of either a TODD or a TODA?


	Current owner retains control. The current owner retains all the rights of ownership and has exclusive control over the property. The owner may do whatever he/she wishes with the property, including changing the designated beneficiary, without seeking permission from the designated beneficiary. You may sell or transfer your real estate without restriction. You do not need the signature of the beneficiary.
	Avoids probate. With a Transfer on Death Deed or Affidavit, real estate passes automatically to the persons named in the Deed or Affidavit. An affidavit must be recorded along with a Death Certificate with the County Recorder.
	Protects Your Asset. Your beneficiaries have no present interest in the real estate. Any legal action such as bankruptcy, divorce, lawsuit or judgment filed against a beneficiary will not affect your real estate. Your beneficiary’s creditor cannot place a lien on your property. Your beneficiary will not be able to transfer, mortgage, or pledge his or her interest in your property during your lifetime.
	Allows a Change of Beneficiary. Beneficiaries listed will have an equal share of the real estate, unless you designate otherwise. If you wish to change the beneficiary of your property or the share they will receive, you may do so without obtaining permission of any past beneficiaries. In other words, you control who you wish to name as beneficiaries and the share they will receive. You can change that designation as you wish.


What It Does Not Do…

Does Not Avoid Estate Tax.

Like any other asset transferring on death, it could be subject to estate tax. However, most legal aid clients will not have to worry about this. Ohio is eliminating estate tax in January 2013. Federal estate tax begins on estates over $5,000,000. There is no tax on gifts to a spouse.

Does Not Protect Your Real Estate From Your Creditors.

Any liens or mortgages created by you or assessed against you during your lifetime will still attach to the real estate and will carry over to your beneficiaries. In other words, this transfer on death designation does not protect your property from your creditors who place liens or mortgages on your property during your lifetime.

Does Not Avoid Inclusion In Determining Medicaid Eligibility.

Your property will be included as your asset in determining your Medicaid eligibility for nursing home care or in-home assistance under Medicaid programs. Your real estate will remain a ‘countable resource’ unless you have a spouse residing in the property or unless you fall under one of the other few exceptions.


	Does Not Avoid Conflicts Among Beneficiaries. If the relationship among your beneficiaries is not cooperative, there could be expense and time involved in resolving disputes after your death.
	Does not automatically transfer a beneficiary’s interest to the beneficiary’s heirs. If a beneficiary on a Transfer on Death deed dies before you, that beneficiary’s share may be terminated. It may not pass to his/her heirs.


o If one beneficiary should predecease you, only the surviving beneficiaries will take a share.

o You do have the right to name contingent beneficiaries to indicate who shall take the interest of the deceased beneficiary.

o If no designated beneficiary survives you, the property will become part of your probate estate.

Survivorship Deed vs. Transfer on Death Deed

In the past, the only type of deed that provided an automatic transfer of real estate at the death of an owner was a “Joint and Survivorship” deed. With a survivorship deed, two or more persons owned the property under a deed that contained some type of “survivor” language (for instance, “to John and Mary, jointly with the right of survivorship” or “to John, Mary, and Jane, or the survivor of them.”)

Unlike the Transfer on Death Deed or Transfer on Death Affidavit, each named person in a survivor deed has a present ownership interest in the real estate. Decisions regarding the property must be made jointly by them. Creditors of any of the joint owners could place a lien on the property.

Whether a survivorship deed or a transfer on death affidavit is best for you depends on your personal circumstances. If you are 55 years of age or older, the type of deed you have will have different consequences if you apply for Medicaid to assist with medical care. You are encouraged to speak with an attorney regarding the type of deed that is best for you.

127,http://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/150,Answers to Will and Probate Questions,"Estate Planning
Probate
Small Estates
Uncontested",,Wills / Estates,"What is a Will?

It’s a written document of a person’s final requests and gifts. A will tells Probate Court how to transfer a person’s property after death. It must be witnessed by two persons. There are other legal requirements. Crossing out or writing in words will invalidate a will. It is best to have an attorney draft a will.

Can I avoid probate if I don’t have a will?

Possibly. Many people own property jointly with a spouse. If a deed is titled ‘joint tenant with right of survivorship’ it passes to the survivor automatically. Automatic transfer happens when there is a surviving owner's name on a deed, life insurance policy, bank account, car title or other document. Property that passes automatically is called ‘non-probate’ property. Probate Court does not decide who should receive non-probate property because there is a document that shows who should receive it. Not all property can be ‘non-probate’ property. Most persons have both probate and non-probate property.

What happens if I own ‘probate property’ but don't have a will?

Without a will, probate property passes according to the Ohio law:


	If there is no surviving spouse, to the children;
	If there are no children, to the surviving spouse;
	If all the deceased’s children are also children of the surviving spouse, to the surviving spouse;
	If there are children of the deceased and the surviving spouse is a parent of one but not all, the first $60,000 to the surviving spouse and the rest divided equally among the children.
	If there is a child of the deceased (step-child of the surviving spouse), the spouse receives the first $20,000. Surviving spouse and child split the remainder.
	If there are children of the decedent (step-children of the surviving spouse), the surviving spouse receives the first $ 20,000. Of the remainder, one-third goes to the spouse and the rest is divided equally among the children.
	If there is neither a surviving spouse nor children, to the nearest relatives in the following order: parents, brothers &amp; sisters or their descendants, grandparents or their descendants, stepchildren or their descendants.


What is Administration of an Estate?

When a person dies, there must be a proceeding in Probate Court before ‘probate property’ can be legally transferred. When a person dies with a will, the executor, supervised by the court, carries out the terms of the will, if possible.

What is Relief from Administration?

This is a simple procedure for small estates. Probate Court can grant Relief from Administration if:


	the value of all the probate property in the estate is below $35,000; or
	below $100,000 and the surviving spouse is entitled to all probate assets.


Probate Court can transfer the assets without a full administration. This simple procedure can save time, court costs and attorney fees. An estate can be relieved from administration even if non-probate property has much higher value.

What happens if there is no Administration or Relief filed in Probate Court?

The probate property would not “legally” belong to anyone. It could not be legally transferred; real estate and automobiles could not be sold. Certain services for homeowners, such as federally subsidized home repair, would not be available.

When is it not necessary to have a Will?If:


	you know you will have no probate property when you die;
	you have made informal arrangements for personal property and you are willing to trust that your wishes will be carried out,
	you are satisfied with a transfer according to the law,
	all your property passes automatically at the time of your death.

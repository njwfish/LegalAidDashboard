This web page cannot explain every aspect of the bankruptcy process. So, if you still have questions after reading it, you should speak with an  attorney who is familiar with bankruptcy. &nbsp; INFORMATION YOU WILL FIND ON THIS WEB PAGE  What is Bankruptcy?

Do I need an attorney? Should I file for Bankruptcy?  &nbsp; WHAT IS BANKRUPTCY? Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding in which a person who cannot pay his or her bills can get  a fresh financial start. The right to file for bankruptcy is provided by federal law, and all  bankruptcy cases are handled in federal court. In most cases, filing bankruptcy immediately stops  all of your creditors from seeking to collect debts from you, at least until your debts are sorted  out according to the law. &nbsp; WHAT CAN BANKRUPTCY DO? Bankruptcy may make it possible for you to:  Eliminate the legal duty to pay most or all of your debts. This is called a  ""discharge"" of debts. It is designed to give you a fresh financial start. Stop foreclosure or repossession of a car or other property so you can catch up on  missed payments. But, in most cases, you will still need to choose between continuing to make  payments or giving the property back. Bankruptcy won't eliminate a lease, mortgage or car loan and  let you keep the property at the same time. Stop wage attachments, debt collection harassment, and similar creditor actions to  collect a debt. Restore or prevent termination of utility service. Allow you to challenge creditors who have committed fraud or who are otherwise trying  to collect more money than you really owe.  &nbsp; WHAT BANKRUPTCY CAN'T DO Bankruptcy can't cure every financial problem, nor is it the right       step for everyone. In bankruptcy, it is usually not possible to:  Eliminate certain obligations to ""secured"" creditors. A ""secured""  creditor is a creditor that can take something (called ""collateral"") if the debt is not  paid as agreed. Common examples are car loans and home mortgages. You can force secured creditors  to take payments over time in the bankruptcy process, and bankruptcy can eliminate your obligation  to pay more money if your property has been taken. But, you generally cannot keep the collateral  unless you keep making payments on the debt. Discharge certain debts singled out by the bankruptcy law for special treatment, such  as child support, alimony, certain other debts related to divorce, most student loans, court  restitution orders, criminal fines, and some taxes. Protect co-signers on your debts. If a relative or friend has co-signed a loan, and  you discharge the loan in bankruptcy, the co-signer may still have to repay all or part of the loan. Discharge debts that arise after bankruptcy has been filed.  &nbsp; WHAT KINDS OF BANKRUPTCY CASES ARE THERE? There are four types of bankruptcy cases provided under the law:  Chapter 7 is know as ""straight"" bankruptcy or ""liquidation."" It  requires a debtor to give up property which exceeds certain limits called ""exemptions,""  so the property can be sold to pay creditors. Chapter 11, known as ""reorganization,"" is used by businesses and a few   individual debtors whose debts are very large. Chapter 12 is reserved for family farmers. Chapter 13 is called ""debt adjustment."" It requires a debtor to file a  plan to pay debts (or parts of debts) from current income.  Most people filing bankruptcy will want to file under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.  Either type of case may be filed individually or by a  married couple filing jointly. &nbsp; CHAPTER 7 In a bankruptcy case under Chapter 7,  you file a petition asking the       court to discharge your debts. The basic idea in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is       to wipe out (discharge) your debts in exchange for you giving up property,       except for ""exempt"" property which the law allows you to keep.       In many cases, much of your personal property will be exempt. But property       which is not exempt is sold so the money can be distributed to creditors. If you want to keep property like a home or a car and you are behind on       the mortgage or car loan payments, a Chapter 7 case probably will not be       the right choice for you. That is because Chapter 7 bankruptcy does not       eliminate the right of mortgage holders or car loan creditors to take your       property to cover your debt, unless you agree to continue making payments. &nbsp; CHAPTER 13 In a Chapter 13 case, you file a ""plan"" showing how you will       pay off some of your past-due and current debts over three to five years.       The most important thing about a Chapter 13 case is that it will allow you       to keep valuable property-especially your home and car-which might       otherwise be lost. But, you must be able to make the required payments to your creditors. In most cases, these payments will be at least as much       as your regular monthly car or mortgage payments, with some extra on top       to get caught up on the amount you have fallen behind. You should consider Chapter 13 if you:  Own your home and are in danger of losing it because of money problems; Are behind on debt payments, but can catch up if given some time; Have valuable property which is not exempt, but you can afford to pay creditors  from your income over a while.  When considering chapter 13, it is important to remember that you must       have enough income to pay for your necessities plus the required       payments as they come due. &nbsp; HOW FREQUENTLY CAN I OBTAIN A BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGE?The chart below will help you determine if you can obtain a discharge in bankruptcy.Prior Case &nbsp;New Case &nbsp;Time period to Wait 7 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;8 years 13 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;6 years with some exceptions 7 &nbsp;13 &nbsp;4 years 13 13 &nbsp;2 yearsWhen calculating the time period, you cont from filing date of the prior  case to the filing date of the new case.&nbsp;MEANS TEST &nbsp;The ""means test"" is a formula set forth by Congress to make sure that  		a Debtor is not able to pay his/her debts. A ""means test"" will be used  		to determine if you have filed bankruptcy under the appropriate Chapter  		(7 or 13). Before filing bankruptcy and as part of the preparation of  		the petition, your attorney (or you, if no attorney is hired) will be  		required to calculate your income, from all sources, for the  six months leading up to the bankruptcy filing date. If, after performing the calculations, your current monthly income is  		greater than the State's median income for a household of your size, and  		shows disposable income ranging from $100.00 to $166.66 per month, then  		a ""presumption of abuse"" would exist. If filing a Chapter 7, you would  		then need to show that ""special circumstances"" exist to rebut the  		presumption, or the you would have to file (or convert to) a Chapter 13  		case. Many factors are taken into consideration in determining a your  		average current monthly income including, but not limited to, gross  		wages, salary, tips, bonuses, overtime and commissions, interest,  		dividends, pension and retirement income, unemployment compensation, and  		any other income that you have received within six months of the filing  		of the petition. If your are interested in filing bankruptcy without an  		attorney, you would need to consult the court's website (or go to the  		Court directly) for instructions on completing the forms and to learn  		what documentation will be required to perform the ""means test""  		calculation. &nbsp; WHAT DOES IT COST TO FILE?  It now costs $299 to file for a chapter 7 and $274 to file for a  		chapter 13. The court may allow you to pay this filing fee in  		installments if you cannot pay all at once. The filing fee may be waived  		entirely for individuals who qualify under very strict fee waiver  		provisions. If you hire a private attorney, you will also have to pay  		the attorney's fees. &nbsp; WHAT PROPERTY CAN I KEEP? Bankruptcy does not change your right to get Social Security,  		unemployment compensation, V.A. benefits, or welfare. Plus, in Delaware,  		you are allowed to ""exempt"" (keep out of bankruptcy) a total of $25,000  		worth of property and up to $50,000 of equity in your principal  		residence. For example, you can exempt $25,000 of the your furniture and  		money in your bank account. Nearly anything can be exempt, so long as  		the value of everything you choose to exempt does not add up to more  		than $25,000 in personal property and $50,000 in equity in principal  		residence. The amounts of the exemptions are doubled (except for the  		principal residence equity exemption) when a married couple files  		together. Also, if only one spouse in a marriage files for bankruptcy, property       that is jointly owned as part of the marriage will be kept out of the       bankruptcy. In determining whether property is exempt, you must keep a few things in mind. The value  of property is replacement value. Remember, although your exemptions allow you to keep property even       in a chapter 7 case, your exemptions do not change the right of a mortgage       company or car loan company to take the house or car to cover the debt if       you are behind. In a chapter 13 case, you can keep all of your property if       your plan meets the requirements of the bankruptcy law. In most cases you       will have to pay the mortgages or liens just as you would if you didn't       file bankruptcy. &nbsp; WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY HOME AND CAR? &nbsp;In most cases you will not lose your home or car during your bankruptcy       case as long as your equity in the property is fully exempt and you       can keep making the regular payments (if the loan is not already paid       off). Even if your property is not fully exempt, you will be able to keep       it, if you pay its non-exempt value to creditors in chapter 13. However, some of your creditors may have a ""security       interest"" in your home, automobile or other personal property. This       means that you gave that creditor a mortgage on the home or put your other       property up as collateral for the debt. Bankruptcy does not make these       security interests go away. If you don't make your payments on that       debt, the creditor may be able to take and sell the home or the property,       during or after the bankruptcy case. There are several ways that you can keep collateral or mortgaged  		property after you file bankruptcy. You can agree to keep making your  		payments on the debt until it is paid in full. In some cases, you can  		pay the creditor the amount that the property you want to keep is worth.  		In some cases involving fraud or other improper conduct by the creditor,  		you may be able to challenge the debt. If you put up your household  		goods as collateral for a loan (other than a loan to purchase the  		goods), you can usually keep your property without making any more  		payments on that debt. &nbsp; CAN I OWN ANYTHING AFTER BANKRUPTCY? &nbsp;Yes! Many people believe that they cannot own anything for a period of       time after filing for bankruptcy. This is not true. You can keep your       exempt property and anything you obtain after the bankruptcy is filed.       However, if you receive an inheritance, a property settlement, or life       insurance benefits within 180 days after filing for bankruptcy, that money       or property may have to be paid to your creditors if the property or money       is not exempt. &nbsp;  CREDIT COUNSELING AND FINANCIAL EDUCATION COURSES The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005  		requires that in order to file bankruptcy you must participate (within  		180 days prior to the filing) in a budget and credit counseling course  		offered by an approved non-profit credit counseling agency. In addition,  		in order to receive a discharge in bankruptcy, the you must participate  		in a financial education course with an approved course provider. The  		U.S. Trustee's office has a list of the approved non-profit credit  		counseling agencies and financial education providers on the website.  		This information can be obtained from the Bankruptcy Clerk's office  		and/or attorney, as well. &nbsp; WILL I HAVE TO GO TO COURT? In most bankruptcy cases, you only need to go to a proceeding called       the ""meeting of creditors"" to meet with the bankruptcy trustee       and any creditor who chooses to come. Most of the time, this meeting will       be a short and simple procedure where you are asked a few questions about       your bankruptcy forms and your financial situation. Occasionally, if complications arise, or if you choose to dispute a       debt, you may need to appear before a judge at a hearing. If you need to       go to court, you will receive notice of the court date and time from the       court and/or from your attorney. &nbsp;  WILL BANKRUPTCY WIPE OUT ALL OF MY DEBTS? No. Bankruptcy will wipe out most debts, but it will not normally wipe out:   Money owed for child support or alimony, fines, and some taxes; Debts not listed on your bankruptcy petition; Loans you got by knowingly giving false information to a creditor, who reasonably  relied on it in making you the loan; Debts resulting from ""willful and malicious"" harm (such as damages caused  by drunk driving); Most student loans; Mortgages and other liens which are not paid in the bankruptcy case (but bankruptcy  will wipe out your obligation to pay any additional money if the property is sold by the creditor).   &nbsp; WILL BANKRUPTCY AFFECT MY CREDIT? There is no clear answer to this question. Unfortunately, if you are       behind on your bills, your credit may already be bad. Bankruptcy will       probably not make things any worse. The fact that you've filed a bankruptcy can appear on your credit       record for ten years. But, since bankruptcy wipes out your old debts, you       are likely to be in a better position to pay your current bills, and you       may be able to get new credit (although most likely at a much higher interest rate). &nbsp; WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW? Utility Services - public utilities, such as the electric       company, cannot refuse or cut off service because you have filed for       bankruptcy. However, the utility can ask for a deposit for future service       and you do have to pay bills that arise after bankruptcy is filed. Discrimination - an employer or government agency cannot       discriminate against you because you have filed for bankruptcy. Driver's License - if you lost your license solely because       you couldn't pay court-ordered damages caused in an accident, bankruptcy       will allow you to get you license back. Co-signers - if someone has co-signed a loan with you and you       file for bankruptcy, the co-signer may have to pay your debt. &nbsp; DO I NEED AN ATTORNEY? &nbsp;Although it may be possible for some people to file a bankruptcy case  		without an attorney, you should not take this step lightly. The  		Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 requires  		Debt Relief Agencies to inform consumers that they do not need an  		attorney to file bankruptcy, however, you should not take this step  		lightly. The process is difficult and you may lose property or other  		rights if you do not know the law. Filing bankruptcy, now more than  		ever, takes patience and careful preparation. &nbsp; SHOULD I FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY? There are many different reasons to file or not. If you are unsure, you       should speak to an attorney for advice. It is important to remember that       bankruptcy will not fix everyone's money problems. &nbsp;When you try to decide what to do, you should first make a monthly       budget. ist, and add up, all of your regular monthly expenses for       necessities. Include expenses like: rent/mortgage payments, utilities,       food, gas or bus fare, clothing, and other regular monthly expenses that       you expect to have even after bankruptcy. If you have a car loan and you       want to keep the car, include the car payments too. Then add up the       monthly income for everyone in the house who shares expenses. Include your       job, public benefit checks, food stamps, pensions, or disability payments. If your income is a lot less than your expenses, then bankruptcy might       not help. Bankruptcy only wipes out old debts. So if your budget       shows that you will have trouble making ends meet after bankruptcy,       or if you think you will still need to use credit cards or borrow money after filing, then you need to think about getting a second job or cutting       expenses (for example, by getting a cheaper car or apartment). Also look at how old your debts are. Most consumer debts only stay on       your credit report for seven years. A bankruptcy will stay for ten years.       So, if your debts are a few years old, it might be better to just hang in       there for a few more years until they are taken off your credit report and       your creditors give up (or until you can pay them)."165,http://www.lscd.com/node/190,New Bankruptcy Law Requires Credit Counseling Before Filing,"Consumer LawsCredit AccessBankruptcy",,Bankruptcy,Before You File for Personal Bankruptcy: Information About Credit Counseling and Debtor Education&nbsp;                                            Contributed by: Federal Trade Commission  Last Reviewed: 07/17/2009http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre41.shtm174,http://www.lscd.com/node/199,Bankruptcy Basics - The Process,"Collection/RepossessionBankruptcy",,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy Basics provides basic information to debtors, creditors,  court personnel, the media, and the general public on different aspects  of the federal bankruptcy laws.

As soon as you file for bankruptcy, Bankruptcy law automatically stops any threatened repossession. However, the secured creditor can later ask the court to lift the automatic stay so that they can proceed with repossession. In some cases, bankruptcy may allow you to recover possession of a vehicle which has already been repossessed. Bankruptcy law also provides you with options to cure defaults and redeem the vehicle which are more favorable than under non-bankruptcy law. For example, in certain circumstances, bankruptcy allows you to redeem the vehicle by paying the fair market value (current value) of the vehicle rather than paying the total amount remaining on the loan."387,http://www.lscd.com/node/424,Understanding Bankruptcy,,,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding in which a person who cannot pay his or her bills can get a fresh financial start.&nbsp; The right to file for bankruptcy is provided by federal law, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal court.&nbsp; In most cases, filing bankruptcy immediately stops all of your creditors from seeking to collect debts from you, at least until your debts are sorted out according to law."388,http://www.lscd.com/node/425,What can bankruptcy do?,Bankruptcy,,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy may make it possible for you to:Eliminate the legal duty to pay most or all of your debts.&nbsp; This is called a â€œdischargeâ€ù of debts.&nbsp; It is designed to give you a fresh financial start.Stop foreclosure or repossession of a car or other property so you can catch up on missed payments.

This       interest allows the creditor to take your vehicle when you have missed       loan payments and have not resolved the problem by contacting the creditor       to work out an alternative payment arrangement. When the creditor takes       your vehicle, it is called a ""repossession."" The creditor can       repossess your vehicle without going to court and without prior notice       unless your security agreement requires notice. &nbsp;WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO MEET YOUR LOAN PAYMENTS? You can delay or avoid repossession of your vehicle, in some cases, if       you talk to your creditor as soon as you realize that you will be late on       a loan payment. When you contact your creditor, you should try to       negotiate a modified payment plan or modification of the loan. You should       ask the creditor to put any modifications in writing. This writing is       generally called a ""workout agreement.""&nbsp;SHOULD YOU VOLUNTARILLY SURRENDER THE CAR?The creditor may ask you to voluntarily surrender the vehicle rather       than wait for them to repossess. This surrender is known as a voluntary       repossession. In general, you should surrender the car voluntarily only in       exchange for the creditor giving up some right, such as, if the creditor       agrees to waive its right to seek the remaining balance owed or agrees not       to report the default to the credit reporting agencies. In addition to       possibly negotiating more favorable terms of repossession, you might save       money by avoiding repossession costs and attorney's fees through       voluntary repossession.&nbsp;DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CURE THE DEFAULT?In most cases, you will not have a right to cure the default,       which means that you will not be able to pay missed payments in       order to get your vehicle back. You only have the right to cure a default       in Delaware if your installment contract provides for a balloon payment       and this balloon payment is the one that you missed. A balloon payment       means a final loan payment that is much larger than the regular payments.       If you have a right to cure the default on the balloon payment, then you       have an absolute right to obtain a new payment schedule, and the payments       under the new schedule must not be substantially greater than your       original installment payments.&nbsp;DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO REDEEM THE VEHICLE?If you are unable to cure the default, you still have an absolute right       to redeem the vehicle any time before the creditor has sold or otherwise       disposed of the vehicle. To redeem your vehicle, you must pay the total       remaining amount of the loan due, not just the delinquent installments.       Plus, you might have to pay reasonable repossession expenses and attorney's       fees if any were actually incurred.&nbsp;COULD BANKRUPTCY HELP YOU PREVENT REPOSSESSION?  You should contact an attorney to find out whether filing a bankruptcy       petition would be the best way to deal with your financial problems. As       soon as you file for bankruptcy, Bankruptcy law automatically stops any       threatened repossession. However, the secured creditor can later ask the       court to lift the automatic stay so that they can proceed with       repossession. In some cases, bankruptcy may allow you to recover       possession of a vehicle which has already been repossessed. Bankruptcy law       also provides you with options to cure defaults and redeem the vehicle       which are more favorable than under non-bankruptcy law. For example, in       certain circumstances, bankruptcy allows you to redeem the vehicle by       paying the fair market value (current value) of the vehicle rather than       paying the total amount remaining on the loan.  Seizing the Vehicle&nbsp;   DOES THE CREDITOR HAVE A VALID SECURITY INTEREST IN THE VEHICLE?A creditor must have a legally enforceable security interest in the       vehicle before they can seize it. ""Security interest"" means a       legal share of the vehicle which secures payment of the debt. The security       interest is created when you sign a security agreement with the creditor.       The security agreement is usually part of the contract you sign when you       buy a vehicle on credit. In order for the security interest to be valid all of the following       must be present: (1) You must have signed the security agreement; (2) The       security agreement must provide a description of the vehicle used as       collateral; and (3) The security agreement must say that you give the       creditor a security interest in the vehicle. Without a valid security       interest a creditor has no legal right to repossess the vehicle. WERE YOU IN DEFAULT?In addition to the requirement that a creditor must have a legally       enforceable security interest in the vehicle, the debtor must also be in       default before they can seize the vehicle. The Delaware Commercial Code       does not define the word ""default."" Typically, the security       agreement defines the word ""default."" For example, an agreement       for Ford Motor Credit Company defines default as follows: You will be in default if:  You do not make a payment when it is due; or You gave false or misleading information on your credit             application relating to this contract; or Your vehicle is seized by any local, state, or federal authority             and is not promptly and unconditionally returned to you; or You file a bankruptcy petition or one is filed against you; or You do not keep any other promise in this contract.  If you are not sure what your security agreement says, keep in mind       that you will be in default on your car loan if you fail to make loan       payments on time, fail to maintain adequate insurance on your vehicle, or       violate some other provision of the agreement.&nbsp; WAS THE SELF-HELP REPOSSESSION PROPERLY CONDUCTED?The secured creditor has a right to repossession after default.       Advanced notice of the repossession is not required in Delaware unless       your contract otherwise requires it. The secured creditor may take       possession of your vehicle without going to court, but it must seize the       vehicle without a breach of peace. Whether a breach of peace has occurred       is ultimately determined by the courts. Remedies are available for you if       the creditor wrongfully seized your vehicle. You should consult an       attorney to determine whether the self-help repossession was properly       conducted and to determine whether any remedies are available.  Selling the Car&nbsp;   WAS THE NOTICE OF SALE PROPER?Although notice is not required prior to the repossession, the creditor       must give you proper notice before selling the vehicle or otherwise       disposing of the vehicle. Notice for private sale of the vehicle is       slightly different than notice for a public sale. The Delaware Commercial       Code states that notice is sufficient if it (1) describes the debtor and       the secured creditor; (2) describes the vehicle being repossessed; (3)       states the method of sale or disposition; (4) states that the debtor is       entitled to an accounting of the amount you owe; (5) states the date, time       and place of a public sale or states that the vehicle will be sold at a       private sale sometime after a certain date; (6) states that the debtor is       liable for any deficiency; (7) provides a telephone number to call so that       the debtor may redeem the vehicle; and (8) provides a telephone number or       mailing address so that the debtor may request more information about the       sale. One example of a creditor who failed to meet reasonable notice       requirements is where the creditor sent notice to debtors at the wrong       street address, a former residence, and sent notice to their current       address with the wrong zip code.&nbsp; WAS THE DISPOSITION OR SALE PROPER?Every aspect of selling or disposing of the vehicle must be       commercially reasonable, including the method, manner, time, place and       terms. Commercial reasonableness includes determining whether there was an       improper delay in the date of the sale. Sales of repossessed vehicles will       be set aside only if the sale price is so low as to shock the conscience       of the court. In general, the standard has been met where the sale price       represented 50% of the fair market value.  Paying the Deficiency&nbsp;   WAS THE DEFICIENCY COMPUTED CORRECTLY?A deficiency is the difference between the amount owed under the       security agreement and the amount the creditor is able to recover upon       selling the vehicle after default. The money from the sale will reduce the       amount you owe. If the creditor gets less money than you owe, you will       still owe the difference. If the creditor gets more money from the sale       than you owe, you will get a refund of the extra money and there is no       deficiency. Typically, to calculate the balance due on the deficiency, the       creditor takes the unpaid amount you owe under the contract plus late       charges, earned and unpaid interest, costs of repossession and sale, minus       the proceeds of the sale. You should receive a rebate for unused credit       insurance and unearned interest. The creditor should only be allowed       reasonable charges for repossession, attorney's fees, storage, towing,       repair and reconditioning expenses. A creditor is allowed to sue you for a       deficiency judgment to collect the remaining amount owed on the       deficiency.&nbsp; IS THE CREDITOR ENTITLED TO A DEFICIENCY?In Delaware, failure to strictly comply with the notice provisions of       the Delaware Commercial Code regarding the sale of the vehicle may be       raised as a defense as to prevent the creditor from recovering a       deficiency judgment. For example, where the creditor provides an       accounting of the amount due in the notice but fails to account for the       rebate of unearned finance charges and insurance premiums, this error in       the amount is a defect in the notice. As a result, the creditor is barred       from recovery of a deficiency. If a creditor sues you for a deficiency       judgment, you should consult an attorney to find out whether you have any       defenses which reduce or completely prevent the deficiency judgment. &nbsp;"134,http://www.lscd.com/node/159,Payday Loans = Costly Cash,"Credit AccessPay Day Loans",,Consumer,"The ads are on the radio, television, the Internet, even in the mail.

But a recent survey by the National Foundation on Credit Counseling (NFCC) shows that that we still may not be saving enough.&nbsp; Sixty-four percent of the 2,700 polled by NFCC said that they would borrow from friends or family, neglect other existing financial obligations, pawn or sell assets, or take out a loan or cash advance on a credit card instead of using their savings to pay off an unexpected $1,000 expense.&nbsp; To increase public awareness of saving, local nonprofit agency Consumer Credit Counseling Service of MD &amp; DE (CCCS) has launched 365 Days &amp; 365 Ways.&nbsp; This year-long effort will utilize social media and community outreach to encourage local residents to put away money now and for the future.According to CCCS Community Outreach and Communications Manager Deanna Booker, â€œToday itâ€™s more important than ever for us to actively budget and save.&nbsp; Having an emergency savings nest egg can help you weather job loss or other situations that may place you at risk of financial ruin. &nbsp;If you donâ€™t have a savings put aside, you may be forced to make poor financial choices like charging up a high-interest credit card or withdrawing money from your 401-K plan.&nbsp; These strategies ultimately leave consumers more financial vulnerable.â€ùBooker also notes that saving is essential to achieving future financial goals. â€œThe cost of education is constantly rising.&nbsp; Saving now can help you pay for tuition and other essential college expenses down the road.&nbsp; At some point most of us hope to retire, but without savings or some type of investment in hand, it may be difficult to make ends meet, especially given weâ€™re all living longer and itâ€™s clear that Social Security probably wonâ€™t pay for it all.â€ù&nbsp;Consumers who are living paycheck-to-paycheck may find it hard to save regularly.&nbsp; However, it is possible -- even on a limited budget.&nbsp; To show how, CCCS is featuring a daily 365 Days &amp; Ways saving tip on its Facebook page.&nbsp; Booker says, â€œTo follow the tips or post your own ideas, just visit CCCSâ€™s Facebook page at CCCS of Maryland and Delaware and become a fan.â€ùTo take the sting out of saving, Booker recommends consumers pay themselves first.&nbsp; â€œIf you have a small amount directly deposited from your paycheck into a savings account each month, youâ€™ll be surprised how quickly money can add up.&nbsp; And where itâ€™s taken out of your paycheck before you ever see it, you probably wonâ€™t even notice that itâ€™s gone.&nbsp; Also look for ways to&nbsp; reduce your expenses.&nbsp; For example, consider packing brown bag lunches for your family to use at school or at work. This is a great way to save money and help ensure that they regularly eat a nutritious meal.â€ù&nbsp; CCCS has several additional saving ideas in the Financial Tools section of its website (www.cccs-inc.org).Consumers who have serious debt problems may need to take control of their finances before they can begin saving.&nbsp; Booker explains, â€œIf this is where you are right now, CCCS can help.&nbsp; We provide free, confidential budget and credit counseling at our offices and by phone.&nbsp; Our counselors are all certified.&nbsp; They can help you assess where you stand financially, set up a personal budget, and explore options that will help you become more financially secure.â€ù&nbsp;According to Booker, Delaware residents who hope to become more financially aware also can take advantage of CCCSâ€™s new website podcasts.&nbsp; â€œOnce youâ€™re on the website, just access the Resources section.&nbsp; It includes podcasts on several subjects, including Successful Money Management and Regaining Financial Control.&nbsp; The podcasts are a great learning tool, because they can be streamed or even downloaded for future listening.â€ùCCCS hopes to enlist other community organizations in the 365 Days &amp; 365 Ways effort.&nbsp; Booker concludes, â€œWeâ€™re looking for local churches, schools, neighborhood groups, and government agencies that can help us put a spotlight on saving by posting this bulletin or linking it to their website or newsletter.&nbsp; Not only will they help promote our grassroots savings movement, theyâ€™ll also help their employees or members increase their financial wellbeing.â€ù&nbsp; Organizations that would like to host a CCCS 365 Days &amp; Ways budget and saving workshop or seminar can call Booker at 410-747-2050.&nbsp;####Consumer Credit Counseling Service of MD &amp; DE, Inc.

This interest allows the creditor to take your vehicle when you have missed loan payments and have not resolved the problem by contacting the creditor to work out an alternative payment arrangement. When the creditor takes your vehicle, it is called a ""repossession."" The creditor can repossess your vehicle without going to court and without prior notice unless your security agreement requires notice."361,http://www.lscd.com/node/396,What should I do if I am unable to meet my car loan payments?,,,Consumer,"You can delay or avoid repossession of your vehicle, in some cases, if you talk to your creditor as soon as you realize that you will be late on a loan payment. When you contact your creditor, you should try to negotiate a modified payment plan or modification of the loan. You should ask the creditor to put any modifications in writing. This writing is generally called a ""workout agreement."""362,http://www.lscd.com/node/397,Should I voluntarily surrender my car if I cannot make the loan payments?,,,Consumer,"The creditor may ask you to voluntarily surrender the vehicle rather than wait for them to repossess. This surrender is known as a voluntary repossession. In general, you should surrender the car voluntarily only in exchange for the creditor giving up some right, such as, if the creditor agrees to waive its right to seek the remaining balance owed or agrees not to report the default to the credit reporting agencies. In addition to possibly negotiating more favorable terms of repossession, you might save money by avoiding repossession costs and attorney's fees through voluntary repossession."363,http://www.lscd.com/node/398,Do I have the right to cure the default if I miss car loan payments?,,,Consumer,"In most cases, you will not have a right to cure the default, which means that you will not be able to pay missed payments in order to get your vehicle back. You only have the right to cure a default in Delaware if your installment contract provides for a balloon payment and this balloon payment is the one that you missed. A balloon payment means a final loan payment that is much larger than the regular payments. If you have a right to cure the default on the balloon payment, then you have an absolute right to obtain a new payment schedule, and the payments under the new schedule must not be substantially greater than your original installment payments."364,http://www.lscd.com/node/399,"If I am unable to cure the default on a car loan, do I have a right to redeem the vehicle?",,,Consumer,"If you are unable to cure the default, you still have an absolute right to redeem the vehicle any time before the creditor has sold or otherwise disposed of the vehicle. To redeem your vehicle, you must pay the total remaining amount of the loan due, not just the delinquent installments. Plus, you might have to pay reasonable repossession expenses and attorney's fees if any were actually incurred."366,http://www.lscd.com/node/401,Vehicle Repossesion: Seizing the Vehicle,,,Consumer,"Does the creditor have a valid security interest in the vehicle?A creditor must have a legally enforceable security interest in the vehicle before they can seize it. ""Security interest"" means a legal share of the vehicle which secures payment of the debt. The security interest is created when you sign a security agreement with the creditor. The security agreement is usually part of the contract you sign when you buy a vehicle on credit.In order for the security interest to be valid all of the following must be present: (1) You must have signed the security agreement; (2) The security agreement must provide a description of the vehicle used as collateral; and (3) The security agreement must say that you give the creditor a security interest in the vehicle. Without a valid security interest a creditor has no legal right to repossess the vehicle.Were you in default?In addition to the requirement that a creditor must have a legally enforceable security interest in the vehicle, the debtor must also be in default before they can seize the vehicle. The Delaware Commercial Code does not define the word ""default."" Typically, the security agreement defines the word ""default."" For example, an agreement for Ford Motor Credit Company defines default as follows:You will be in default if:You do not make a payment when it is due; orYou gave false or misleading information on your credit application relating to this contract; orYour vehicle is seized by any local, state, or federal authority and is not promptly and unconditionally returned to you; orYou file a bankruptcy petition or one is filed against you; orYou do not keep any other promise in this contract.If you are not sure what your security agreement says, keep in mind that you will be in default on your car loan if you fail to make loan payments on time, fail to maintain adequate insurance on your vehicle, or violate some other provision of the agreement.Was the self-help repossession properly conducted?The secured creditor has a right to repossession after default. Advanced notice of the repossession is not required in Delaware unless your contract otherwise requires it. The secured creditor may take possession of your vehicle without going to court, but it must seize the vehicle without a breach of peace. Whether a breach of peace has occurred is ultimately determined by the courts. Remedies are available for you if the creditor wrongfully seized your vehicle. You should consult an attorney to determine whether the self-help repossession was properly conducted and to determine whether any remedies are available."367,http://www.lscd.com/node/402,Vehicle Repossession: Selling the Car,,,Consumer,"Was the&nbsp; notice of sale proper?&nbsp;Although notice is not required prior to the repossession, the creditor must give you proper notice before selling the vehicle or otherwise disposing of the vehicle. Notice for private sale of the vehicle is slightly different than notice for a public sale. The Delaware Commercial Code states that notice is sufficient if it (1) describes the debtor and the secured creditor; (2) describes the vehicle being repossessed; (3) states the method of sale or disposition; (4) states that the debtor is entitled to an accounting of the amount you owe; (5) states the date, time and place of a public sale or states that the vehicle will be sold at a private sale sometime after a certain date; (6) states that the debtor is liable for any deficiency; (7) provides a telephone number to call so that the debtor may redeem the vehicle; and (8) provides a telephone number or mailing address so that the debtor may request more information about the sale. One example of a creditor who failed to meet reasonable notice requirements is where the creditor sent notice to debtors at the wrong street address, a former residence, and sent notice to their current address with the wrong zip code.Was the disposition of sale proper?Every aspect of selling or disposing of the vehicle must be commercially reasonable, including the method, manner, time, place and terms. Commercial reasonableness includes determining whether there was an improper delay in the date of the sale. Sales of repossessed vehicles will be set aside only if the sale price is so low as to shock the conscience of the court. In general, the standard has been met where the sale price represented 50% of the fair market value."368,http://www.lscd.com/node/403,Vehicle Repossession: Paying the Deficiency,,,Consumer,"Was the deficiency computed correctly?A deficiency is the difference between the amount owed under the security agreement and the amount the creditor is able to recover upon selling the vehicle after default. The money from the sale will reduce the amount you owe. If the creditor gets less money than you owe, you will still owe the difference. If the creditor gets more money from the sale than you owe, you will get a refund of the extra money and there is no deficiency. Typically, to calculate the balance due on the deficiency, the creditor takes the unpaid amount you owe under the contract plus late charges, earned and unpaid interest, costs of repossession and sale, minus the proceeds of the sale. You should receive a rebate for unused credit insurance and unearned interest. The creditor should only be allowed reasonable charges for repossession, attorney's fees, storage, towing, repair and reconditioning expenses. A creditor is allowed to sue you for a deficiency judgment to collect the remaining amount owed on the deficiency.&nbsp;Is the creditor entitled to a deficiency? In Delaware, failure to strictly comply with the notice provisions of the Delaware Commercial Code regarding the sale of the vehicle may be raised as a defense as to prevent the creditor from recovering a deficiency judgment. For example, where the creditor provides an accounting of the amount due in the notice but fails to account for the rebate of unearned finance charges and insurance premiums, this error in the amount is a defect in the notice. As a result, the creditor is barred from recovery of a deficiency. If a creditor sues you for a deficiency judgment, you should consult an attorney to find out whether you have any defenses which reduce or completely prevent the deficiency judgment."369,http://www.lscd.com/node/404,Buying & Owning a Car in Delaware,Automobiles,,Consumer,"Learn about how to buying, owning, and repaining a car in Delaware."398,http://www.lscd.com/node/437,Debt Action - Justice of the Peace Interactive Form,Collection/Repossession,,Consumer,"This is an online interview that guides you through completing a JP Court form for a debt action.

To do so, the landlord must first send you a letter stating that unless all of the rent due is paid, the landlord will terminate the lease and take you to court.&nbsp; The letter must set a deadline giving you at least 5 days to pay. This letter is often called a ""Five Day Letter.""Then, if you do not pay in full or move out by the deadline, the landlord can go to Justice of the Peace Court and file a case asking for the rent money and to have you evicted. Remember that the amount of money you owe could include late fees and back rent from previous months. The law allows the landlord to ask you to pay all of it or be taken to court.Violating An Important Part Of The Lease Or Landlord-Tenant CodeMost leases include rules and promises by the tenant. Some examples are: a promise to not make noise that disturbs the neighbors, or a promise not to run a business out of the house without the landlord's permission. The Landlord-Tenant Code also includes rules that are made a part of all leases automatically, even if the lease is not written down. Some of these are: a promise to keep the property clean and safe, and a promise not to damage or destroy any part of the property.If you break one of these rules or promises, the landlord can go to court to have you evicted. To do so, the landlord must first give you a letter that does the following:		explain what rule you have broken and what you are doing wrong,			give you at least 7 days to correct the problem (not 5 days as when rent is late),			tell you that if the problem is not corrected by the deadline, the landlord may terminate the lease and go to court to have you evicted,			warn you that if the same rule is broken again within 1 year, the landlord can go directly to court without giving a new notice.	If you do not fix the problem, or if you fix it and break the same rule again within 1 year, your landlord can take you to court to have you evicted.Conviction Of A Class ""A"" Misdemeanor Or FelonyIf you (or a family member living on the premises) is convicted of a class A misdemeanor or a felony while living in the house or apartment and the conduct that led to the conviction caused or threatened to cause irreparable (unfixable) harm to any person or property, the landlord can immediately terminate the lease and go to court for an eviction. In this situation, the landlord does not need to warn you with a letter.Holding-OverFor people that rent month to month, with no set ending date for when you must leave, the landlord can end the lease by giving you, at least, 60 days written notice.&nbsp; If you have a lease with an ending date, the landlord must tell you 60 days before the lease ends, in writing, that he will not be renewing the lease. Otherwise, after the ending date, it continues month to month.If the landlord has notified you that the lease will not be renewed, then you must move out by the last day of the lease.If you do not move out, then you are ""holding-over"" and the landlord can go to court and seek to have you evicted.&nbsp; The landlord does not need to give any additional warning or notices. The notice that the lease would not be renewed is enough.If you lose in court, the law says that you can be ordered to pay double your daily rent as a penalty until you move out.When Your Landlord Takes You To CourtIf your landlord has gone to court to evict you, the court will notify you and tell you when and where to go to court. You will be notified in one of two ways:		By certified mail, return receipt requested:					If you get a card from the Post Office telling you to pick up some certified mail, GET IT! If you do not, the court will evict you anyway and you will not get a chance to defend yourself.						By Constable:					A Constable will try to deliver the notice to you in person.&nbsp; If you are not home, he will tape it to your door.				Normally, the court date will be 2 to 4 weeks after the date your landlord files his case.(It can be more or less.) The date depends on how busy the court is.If you get a notice telling you to go to court, don't ignore it.If you want help, call one of the numbers at the end of this brochure.On the court date, be sure to go to court early. There will be a trial in front of a judge. Both you and the landlord will have a chance to tell their side of the story. If you do not go to court, your landlord will win.&nbsp; If you are late, the court will go ahead without you, so get there early.If You Lose In CourtIf you lose in court and your landlord has asked for ""possession"" of your apartment or house, the court will order you to move out. If there was a complete trial on the summary possession and you lose, you will only have 5 days to appeal.On the other hand, if a ""default judgment"" is entered (most likely if you did not appear for court), you will only have 10 days to file a ""motion to vacate"".If you do not appeal and ask for a ""stay of proceedings,"" the court will issue a 24 hour eviction notice to the Constable who will most likely post it on your door within a week after the time to appeal is up. Also, to prevent execution on the judgment during the time of the appeal, you must provide a bond or otherwise demonstrate your ability to pay all court costs, money damages and rent, if you lose the appeal.When you get an eviction notice, act fast!The 24 hour eviction notice means that the Constable will be back in a minimum of 24 hours.&nbsp; If you are still there, he will make you leave.&nbsp; The constables only work during daylight hours, Monday through Friday. So, if the 24 hour notice is posted on Friday, you will have at least until Monday morning.If you do not have all of your belongings out of the house by the time the Constable comes back, you will have to leave them behind.The landlord can remove your belongings and store them or leave them where they are for 7 days. If the landlord wants to, he can charge you for storing your property.If, at the end of 7 days, you have not claimed your property, the landlord can do whatever he wants with your property including keep it, sell it, or leave it on the street. He cannot hold your property hostage until you pay the rent but he can ask for his storage costs.Making A DealIf you want make a deal or payment arrangement with your landlord, try to get it in writing and be sure you understand exactly how much you must pay and when. A court judgment for back rent will usually include interest and court costs, so you may owe more money than you expect.Unfortunately, your landlord is not required to make a deal with you or accept a payment plan. He might want all his money immediately.So, if you think you might lose in court, or if you don't have enough money to pay your landlord, start looking for a new place to stay immediately. Do not let yourself and your family be left without a home.There are some things a landlord can never do to evict you. They are:		Change the locks without getting a court judgment against you first.			Turn off the electricity, gas, or water.			Take any of your property.			Threaten to hurt you or anyone else if you dont pay.	Where To Call For HelpNew Castle County and Sussex CountyLegal Services Corporation of Delaware, Inc.100 West 10th Street, Suite 203, WilmingtonNew Clients Call: (302) 478-8850Kent CountyLegal Services Corporation of Delaware, Inc.208 S.

What you can afford will be up to you, but when you look at advertisements, remember that if the price seems too good to be true for the size and location of the rental unit - then it probably is! Most urban areas of Delaware have a shortage of good, affordable rental units, so if it sounds like a bargain, it will probably be because the rental unit is in bad condition.The condition and location of the rental unit can affect the health and safety of you and your family. Buildings that have not been properly maintained may have lead paint, poor heating or plumbing and other problems. Buildings in some areas will have illegal drug activity in the hallways. Before you consider renting something in bad condition or in a bad area because you think you can't afford anything better, ask yourself if it would be better to pay the same amount of money for a smaller, but safer, apartment elsewhere. After living in a bad location for a while, you'll decide that giving up size for more safety is a good trade.Finding a safe place to rent or deciding if a specific rental unit is safe is easier than it sounds. One of the best ways to find a safe place to live is to ask around. Your friends and family may know of good landlords with good buildings available for rent. Such rental units may never be advertised in the newspaper. If you are interested in a specific apartment building, complex, or house, ask around to see if anyone knows about its reputation for safety or other problems.Before agreeing to rent any rental unit, call the local building inspector to ask about the area and the building. The telephone book or Legal Services Corp. of Delaware can help you find the right telephone number to call. If you are renting in the City of Wilmington, all rental units must pass a pre-rental inspection BEFORE the landlord can take any money from you or rent it out. Call the Department of Licenses and Inspections (576-3030) to find out if your rental unit passed inspection.You can check the quality of the rental unit yourself. Walk around and look for problems. Run the water in the sinks and flush the toilets. Try the heater or air conditioner if possible. Open all the cabinets in the kitchen to check for insects. If possible walk around the hallways if you are looking at an apartment building. Also walk around the neighborhood. If you don't feel safe - don't rent there.&nbsp;Conditions in the Rental UnitUnder the Delaware Landlord-Tenant Code, landlords have a legal duty to keep a rental unit in a safe and clean condition. That includes making any necessary repairs while you live there. Local laws, such as county and city codes also have specific requirements. All rental units must have heat and hot water. If you think your rental unit has a problem the landlord should fix,  send the landlord a letter explaining what repairs are necessary (keep a copy, you might need it later). If the repairs are not made, call the local building inspector and talk with them about it. Remember that you cannot be evicted or punished by the landlord for calling an inspector. If your landlord tries to do something to you because you called an inspector, or if the repairs are not made, call Legal Services or the Attorney General's office.Withholding rent from a landlord is risky business. In the City of Wilmington, the inspectors can help you set up a rent withholding account IF the conditions are bad enough. Withholding rent on your own is almost guaranteed to get you sued by your landlord for non-payment of rent. If the judge disagrees with the amount you withheld, and you can't pay the amount you owe right away, you could get evicted.Remember that you can take your landlord to court in order to get problems fixed or if the landlord has done something else to violate the lease. You do not need a lawyer to take your landlord to court.Beware of landlords that promise to fix things after you move in. Once you give them your money and move in, they have less incentive to keep their promise. Tell them you will only rent the unit if the problems are fixed before you give him any money.Tenants have responsibilities for the condition of the rental unit too. If you, a family member, or a guest damage anything, you will be responsible for fixing it. If it is not fixed by the time you move out, the landlord is allowed to keep part of your security deposit to pay for repairs. If there is repeated damage, or if the damage is serious enough, you could even be taken to court and evicted. So take good care of your rental unit. Even if you don't own it, you are responsible for it.Your LeaseWhenever you rent a house or apartment, you make a lease. Even if you never sign anything and just give the landlord some money in exchange for the key - you still have a lease. Oral and written leases are both legal and can be enforced in court. A lease is a promise by you to pay the rent every month on the day it is due. It is also a promise by the landlord to give you a rental unit that is clean and safe. If your landlord can't keep his promise by letting you into your apartment, or by keeping it in safe condition, you can take him to court and he will get in trouble. BUT if you don't keep your promise by paying the rent, the landlord can take you to court and evict you. Just like you don't need to tolerate the landlord's excuses (I'll fix it next week, etc.), the law says your landlord does not need to tolerate your excuses for not paying the rent (""I lost my job, I'll have the money in a couple weeks""). Renting is a two-way street, so make sure you can pay your rent on time, or start looking for a more affordable place to live.If your landlord offers you a written lease, READ IT from one end to the other BEFORE you sign it. Leases can include rules such as ""no pets."" If you break these rules, you can be evicted, so its very important to know about them. Also, sometimes a landlord will ask you to sign a lease that says he has given you a copy of the Landlord-Tenant Code. Your landlord is required to give you a copy of the  Landlord-Tenant Code. If he doesn't, don't sign! You may be giving up some of your legal protections if you say you got a copy when you really didn't. Beware of any landlord or rental agent that says ""we'll work it out"" or ""don't worry about that"" when you see something you don't like in the lease. If it's written in the lease, the landlord's words don't matter. All that matters is what's in writing. If your landlord offers to work something out, get it in writing or it won't happen.If your lease doesn't have a starting and ending date, then the law says your lease runs from month to month. The only way to end a month to month lease is by giving your landlord a letter (telling her isn't good enough) saying you want to end your lease. By law, you must give your landlord 2 months notice (start counting from the 1st day of the upcoming month). If you give less, you will be responsible for the rent anyway. This is also the only way your landlord can end a month to month lease with you. Thirty days notice isn't enough.BUT remember that if you break a rule, or don't pay rent, the 60 day rule doesn't apply and you can be evicted with much less notice. You are still entitled to written notice, but you will only get 5-7 day's notice and the landlord may take you to court to evict you.If you have a lease with an ending date, and the ending date goes by, and you keep living there with your landlord's permission, your lease changes to a month to month lease. If you want another lease with a specific ending date (such as another 1 year lease), you must sign a new lease with the landlord. If you keep living there without your landlord's permission, that makes you a ""holdover tenant."" If you are a holdover tenant, your landlord can go to court and get you evicted. You will also be ordered to pay rent for the time you stayed, and you could even be ordered to pay DOUBLE the rent as a penalty. If you are worried about this happening, be sure to call Legal Services or the Attorney General for free advice.&nbsp;Rent MoneyA big part of your lease is the date the rent is due and what happens if it's late. If rent is due the 1st of the month and you pay on the 2nd of the month, your rent is late. Even though the law says the landlord can't charge a late fee until you are at least 5 days late, the rent is still late. If your rent is late a lot, you could be evicted or your landlord might refuse to renew your lease.If your pay or benefit check comes later in the month, such as on the 15th, and you think you won't have the money to pay the rent on the 1st of every month, ask the landlord to change the due date for the rent. The best time to ask is BEFORE you sign the lease. Despite what some landlords might tell you, the rent due date can be any date that you and the landlord agree on. Just make sure it's written in the lease. Many people have leases that say their rent is due on the 15th of the month instead of the 1st. If you get paid on the 15th each month, changing your due date will be better than being late every month.When your rent is late enough that the landlord can charge you with a late fee, you must pay the rent + the late fee, or the landlord can go to court and say you didn't pay the rent. If the next month comes, any money you pay goes to back-rent and late fees 1st. For example, if you don't pay January's rent and then February comes and you pay rent on the 1st of February, your landlord will use the money to pay January's rent and you will still owe a late fee for January + a late fee for February + February's rent. If you pay late, the late fee becomes part of your rent bill. If you don't pay the late fee, you can be evicted.For this reason, it is very important to keep track of how much money you pay and when. Keep your receipts and  keep a list of payments. That way, if your landlord claims you didn't pay, you can prove you did. Don't trust your landlord to keep track for you.&nbsp;Evictions &amp; LockoutsYour landlord can NEVER, NEVER lock you out or evict you, or make the rental unit unlivable (ex. by turning off the heat or water) without going to court and getting permission. If the landlord does otherwise, call Legal Services immediately for help or go to the Justice of the Peace Court and file a case to get back in. For temporary food and shelter, call the  Delaware Help Line, 1-800-464-4357.The court always sends you notice when the landlord requests to have you evicted and if the landlord wins permission to have you evicted. If you get a letter from a court or your landlord that talks about going to court, don't ignore it! That notice could mean that you will get locked out legally if you don't do something. Legal Services can talk to you about such letters if you need help - but you must call as soon as you get the notice. If you delay, you could give up your rights. Certified mail is especially important because the court sends papers that way - pick it up! Read the Legal Services Evictions brochure to learn more.&nbsp;Moving OutTo end a lease, make sure you tell the landlord in advance and return your key. You can never go wrong by giving your landlord a  letter 60 days in advance saying when you will move out. Telling your landlord that you will be moving ""soon"" without a date is not good enough. Your landlord is entitled to know exactly when you are moving or she has the right to assume you will stay indefinitely. (Imagine if your landlord said ""you can move into your new apartment soon"" but never told you exactly when!) Just remember that when you tell the landlord you are moving out, the landlord will probably start looking for a new tenant to replace you, so it may be impossible to take back your move-out notice. If you move out before the lease ends, or before you said you were going to leave, you could owe rent from the day you actually left to the day originally said you were going to move.&nbsp;Security DepositIf you have a security deposit, when you move out you should also give the landlord a forwarding address in writing so you can  get your deposit back Make sure the apartment is clean and fix anything you broke. You must remove everything you own. Take pictures and have a friend look at the empty apartment before you give the key back so you have proof of how it looked. Give the key to the landlord by hand. Never slide it under the door. If the landlord thinks you haven't returned the key, you will be charged for rent as if you still lived there. If necessary, send it by ""certified mail, return receipt requested."" Your landlord is allowed to keep part or all of your deposit to change the locks because you didn't return the key, for back rent, damages, dirt, or for removing anything you left behind.After you move out, you should get a letter within 20 days that either includes a check for your deposit or a letter from your landlord saying she is keeping part of your deposit and giving you a check for the rest. If the landlord keeps some or all of your deposit, STOP! If you want the rest of the deposit back, you must send a letter complaining about the deduction to the landlord. You have 10 days to do this. If you wait, you are stuck. Also don't cash that check!! If you do, you won't get the rest of your money back. If you don't get a letter or your deposit, you can go to court to get it. Ask Legal Services for details.&nbsp;UtilitiesUtilities are a big deal when you move in and when you move out. If the utilities are in your name, they stay that way until they are shut-off, or someone else (like a roommate or the landlord) agrees to let the bill get put into their name. If you have trouble paying the utility bill, call the Delaware Help Line 1-800-464-4357 for a referral to an energy assistance program (these are usually only available in the winter). You can also ask the power company to set up an averaging bill payment plan. That way your bill will be the same almost every month and it will be easier to make a budget.When you move out,  call the power company in advance to make sure the bill is either switched into someone else's name, or that the power is shut off. If the utilities are to be shut off, make sure you personally let them in to shut-off the power. Your electricity can usually not be turned off without access to your apartment or house. Don't trust anyone else to do it. If you move out and the power is still on, the landlord can rent the apartment or house to someone else and the new tenant (or the landlord) will get free electricity and gas that you will get billed for. If you want to get utilities at your new home, you will have a lot of trouble because of the old apartment. Once this happens, it is very hard to ever get the utilities at the old house or apartment taken out of your name. You will end up with a huge bill on your credit report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renting an apartment isn't hardif you use common sense and follow the rules.Legal Services Corporation of Delawarewill help tenants with questions and problems*&nbsp;* Before Providing Any Advice or Assistance All Clients Must Tell UsTheir Income and Must Meet Our Eligibility Requirements&nbsp;"270,http://www.lscd.com/node/296,Guide to Tenant's Rights and Responsibilities,"EvictionsLandlord/Tenant",,Housing,"Renting an apartment or house is something almost everyone  does sooner or later.

These communities are also known as mobile home parks, trailer  courts, and trailer parks (MHP). If you are renting a lot in an MHP that leases  two or more lots, you are covered by the MHOCCA.&nbsp;If you are renting a manufactured home in an MHP, you are covered by  the Delaware Residential Landlord Tenant Code.  If you do not already have a copy of the MHOCCA and/or the Landlord-Tenant  Code, call the  Attorney General's office  at 1-800-220-5424 to request one or  look for them  here . &nbsp; ACTS OF RETALIATION BY LANDLORDS ARE ILLEGAL Your landlord cannot evict you or cut your services within 90 days of any of  the following:you made a proper complaint about a code violation to the  landlord or  	enforcement agency an enforcement agency has  begun action against the landlord based on  	your complaint you  have formed or joined a tenant's organization you have filed a  legal action against the landlord for any reason.  If your landlord tries to retaliate against you, you may be entitled to  whichever is greater: three months of rent or three times the damages suffered  plus Court costs. &nbsp; EVICTION A landlord can legally evict a renter for several reasons, including the  following:Not paying rent.&nbsp; Deducting money from the rent. Breaking part of the lease. Failing to follow the  Manufactured Home Owners and Community Owners Act  	or the Landlord  Tenant Code. Breaking rules and regulations of the  manufactured home community. Holding-over (staying after the  lease ends without permission). Conviction of a crime during  your lease. Rental unit has been sold or foreclosed on.  &nbsp; A landlord can NEVER evict a tenant for these reasons:The renter files a complaint about problems with the rental  unit. The renter requests that the landlord honor the terms of  the lease  	and/or make repairs. The renter sues the landlord  for violating the lease or the law. Race, religion, sex,  marital status, national origin, disability, age,  	or occupation. The renter has children. &nbsp; Not Paying Rent &nbsp;If you do not pay the amount of lot rent that is due every month, the  landlord can go to court to evict you. After the rent is five days late,  the landlord must send you a letter stating that unless all the rent due is  paid, the landlord will end the lease and take you to court. The letter must set  a deadline giving you at least seven days to pay. The law allows the  landlord to request payment in full or you can be sued. &nbsp;If you do not pay in full or move out by the deadline, the landlord can go to  the Justice of the Peace Court and file a complaint asking for the rent money  and to have you evicted. This is called a ""Summary Possession"" action.  Remember that the amount of money you owe could include late fees and back rent  from previous months. &nbsp; Failure to Follow Rules and Regulations &nbsp; There are some things a landlord can never do to evict you.   They can't change the locks.  They can't turn off the electricity, gas, or water.  They can't take any of your property.  They can't threaten to hurt you or anyone else if you don't  			pay.  Most leases include rules and regulations that you must follow. By signing  the lease, you promise to follow the rules and regulations. Some examples are a  promise not to make noise that disturbs the neighbors, or a promise not to run a  business out of the manufactured home without the landlord's permission. The  MHOCCA also includes rules that are made a part of all leases automatically,  even if the lease is not written down. Some of these are a promise to keep the  property clean and safe, and a promise not to damage or destroy any part of the  property. If you break one of these rules or promises, the landlord can go to court to  have you evicted. First, the landlord must give you a letter that does  the following:explains in detail what rule you have broken, what you have  done wrong,  	and when you broke the rule; gives you at least  twelve days to correct the problem, if you own the  	manufactured home  and rent the lot; tells you that if the problem is not  corrected by the deadline, the  	landlord may end the lease and go to  court to have you evicted. &nbsp; Conviction of a Crime If you (or a family member, even a juvenile, living on the premises) are  convicted of a crime while living in the MHP and the conduct that led to the  conviction caused or threatened to cause irreparable (unfixable) harm to any  person or property, the landlord can immediately end the lease and ask the court  for an eviction. In this situation, the landlord does not need to warn you with  a letter. &nbsp; Holding-over&nbsp; A holdover tenant is one who continues to possess (keep their manufactured  home on) the lot they rented in the MHP when they have no right to do so. If, after a trial, a Judge issues an order giving the rented lot back to the  landlord, or if a lease agreement is legally ended by the landlord, and you  continue to stay after the expiration date without the landlord's permission,  you must pay the landlord twice the daily rate of rent as damages. For example,  if the lot's monthly rent is $300.00, the daily rate is $10.00 per day. If you  hold over in ""bad faith"" after termination by the Court, the rent would double  to $20.00 per day as damages to the landlord. If, however, you hold over in ""good faith"" after termination by the Court,  the landlord will not be entitled to double damages. A ""good faith"" dispute  means there is an honest difference of opinion relating to the rights of the  parties to a rental agreement. &nbsp; NON-RENEWAL AND TERMINATION OF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT The rental agreement between you and your landlord must provide written  standards which list all possible reasons for non-renewal or termination of your  rental agreement. &nbsp; Grounds for Non-Renewal&nbsp; If your landlord decides not to renew your lease agreement, he/she must have  ""due cause."" Due cause is defined as a change in land use of the MHP. An example  of change in land use is where a landlord decides to build a shopping center  where the MHP is located. In addition, the following reasons are considered due  cause for not renewing your lease:conduct that caused or threatened to cause immediate,  irreparable harm  	as demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence; or conviction of a crime that caused or threatened to cause immediate,   	irreparable harm to another tenant or their property in the MHP as  	 demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence; or false  information on your rental application which, if the truth was  	known,  would have caused denial; or failure to provide proper notice  to landlord of the sale or transfer of  	your manufactured home; or failure to bring your manufactured home into compliance with  written  	standards of the MHP.  Your Landlord must send you a notice for non-renewal, in writing, at least 60  days before the expiration of your lease agreement. The notice must clearly  state the reason(s) and specify the date, place, and circumstance(s) causing the  non-renewal. &nbsp; Ending Lease Due to Change of Land Use&nbsp; If your lease is being ended due to change of land use, the landlord must  provide written notice one year before the expiration date. The notice must do  the following:inform you of the intended change of land use; and advise  you of the need to secure another location for your manufactured  	home;  and provide a relocation plan to assist renters.  If your rental agreement is being ended for change of land use, you may be  entitled to moving expenses as well as reimbursement for a manufactured home  that is too old to be moved. &nbsp;  Delaware Manufactured Home Relocation Trust Fund The MHOCCA has established a trust fund for use in cases when a tenant  	must relocate because of changes in land use. The trust fund consists of a  	monthly assessment of $3.00 per manufactured home for each rented lot in a  	manufactured home community. The tenant and the landlord split this fee. The  	tenant pays their half as part of their monthly rent. The applicability and  	availability of funds depend on the circumstances of each individual case. &nbsp; Grounds for Immediate Termination&nbsp; Your landlord may immediately end your rental agreement after sending a  written notice to you for any of the five reasons mentioned previously in  ""Grounds for Non-Renewal."" &nbsp; Grounds for Ending Your Rental Agreement &nbsp;Your landlord has the right to end your rental agreement under certain  conditions. The following is a list of reasons why your lease can be ended:you did not obey the rules of the rental agreement or the  MHOCCA and  	disrupted the rights of others entitled to the quiet  enjoyment of the MHP;  	this reason requires a written notice  to immediately stop the  		specific conduct and to not repeat it within  six months or face  		immediate termination through an action for  summary possession  		(eviction) you did  not keep your premises in good condition;  	this reason  requires a written notice of the specific condition and  		allow you  twelve days from date of mailing or delivery to fix the  		condition or  face immediate termination you did not  pay your rent;this reason requires a written notice after you  are five days late  		which states that failure to pay within seven days  of mailing or date of  		delivery will result in termination if you have broken the rules of the rental  agreement or the MHOCCA  	several times within a twelve-payment period,  it may result in immediate  	termination or refusal to renew your lease  agreement. Some examples include:four late payments; orfailure  to reimburse landlord on two occasions for utility bills  		after  receiving written notice giving you seven days to pay; orwriting  two bad checks; orfour separate incidents of breaking the  rules; orany combination of four separate incidents of not  following the  		rules of the MHOCCA.  &nbsp; TERMINATION BY TENANT &nbsp;You may end your lease agreement by giving your landlord a written notice at least sixty days before your lease expires. If you move in and find that the landlord is not keeping to the rental  agreement or is breaking portions of a government code, you have up to a month  to end your lease with a written notice and seek damages. Also, if you have a condition that prevents you from receiving your part of  the bargain, you must send your landlord a written notice describing the problem  and give him/her fifteen days to fix it. If the landlord does not then fix the  problem, you are allowed to end your rental agreement, move, and seek damages. &nbsp;You have eighteen months from signing to end the rental agreement and seek  damages, if your landlord misrepresents a fact just to get you to enter into a  rental agreement. If you have to move more than 30 miles because of your employment or you are  reassigned by the Armed Forces, you are allowed to end your rental agreement.  You have to give your landlord at least 30 days written notice. &nbsp; WHEN YOUR  LANDLORD TAKES YOU TO COURT If your landlord has gone to court to evict you, the court will notify you  and tell you when and where to go to court. You will be notified in one of the  following ways:By first class mail, with a certificate of mailing By  certified mail, return receipt requested By Constable The  notice may be delivered personally to you at your manufactured home,  	 or The notice may be delivered personally to an adult residing  at your  	manufactured home. A Constable will try to deliver the notice to you in person. If  you are  	not home, he will tape it (post) to your door. &nbsp;Normally, the court date will be within four weeks after the date your  landlord files his case. (It can be more or less.) The date depends on how busy  the court is. On the court date, be sure to go to court early. There will be a trial in  front of a judge. Both you and the landlord will have a chance to tell your side  of the story. If you do not go to court, your landlord will win. If you are  late, the court will go ahead without you, so get there early. Go to court  even if your landlord tells you it is not necessary. &nbsp; IF YOU LOSE IN COURT If you lose in court and your landlord has asked for ""possession"" of  your manufactured home or rental lot, the court will order you to move out. You  will have five days to appeal. If you do not appeal and ask for a ""stay  of execution on the judgment,"" the landlord may then ask the court to issue a  24-hour eviction notice to the Constable who will post it on your door as early  as two weeks after the judgment.&nbsp; This notice means the Constable will be back in 24 hours. If you are still  there, he will make you leave. The constables only work during daylight hours,  Monday through Friday. So, if the 24-hour notice is posted on Friday, you will  have at least until Monday morning, if it is not a holiday. If you do not have all of your belongings out of the manufactured home by the  time the Constable comes back, you will have to leave them behind. If the landlord has asked for ""possession"" of the lot, you may prepay a  storage fee in the amount equivalent to seven days rent. You must pay the amount  on or before the date the eviction notice is posted. If the amount is prepaid  then the court may extend the notice period for removal of the manufactured home  for seven days. You cannot, however, live in the home during the seven  days. If, after the seven-day notice period has ended, you do not remove the  manufactured home, the landlord may remove the manufactured home from the lot.  The manufactured home must be stored for up to thirty days at your expense. You  cannot remove the manufactured home from the storage location until the landlord  has been paid:the amount of the judgment, and reasonable costs of  removal and storage of the manufactured home. If, at the end of the thirty days, you have not claimed your manufactured  home and reimbursed the landlord for the cost of removal and storage, the  landlord can do whatever he wants with your manufactured home including keep it,  sell it, or junk it. &nbsp; MAKING A DEAL If you want to make a deal or payment arrangement with your landlord, try to  get it in writing and be sure you understand exactly how much you must pay and  when. A court judgment for back rent will usually include interest and court  costs, so you may owe more money than expected. &nbsp;Unfortunately, your landlord is not required to make a deal with you or  accept a payment plan. He might want all of his money immediately. In addition,  even if you make a payment towards back rent but allow your landlord to get  legal possession, you could still be evicted by the Constable, if the landlord  chooses to follow through with eviction. So, if you think you might lose in court, or if you don't have enough money  to ay your landlord, start looking for a new place to stay immediately. Do not  let yourself and your family be left without a place to live. &nbsp; GLOSSARY OF TERMS Appeal: To take steps to have your case reheard in Court.

A ""pet deposit"" means any deposit held by the landlord because the tenant keeps an animal in a rental unit. When the landlord requires a tenant to pay a fee to determine the tenant's credit worthiness, this fee is called an ""application fee."" It is illegal for the prospective landlord or owner of the rental unit to ask for any ""assurance money"" or other payment which is not an application fee, security deposit, or pet deposit.&nbsp;Is the Landlord Allowed to Ask for A Pet Deposit?A landlord may require a pet deposit unless the pet is a duly certified and trained support animal for a disabled person. It is unlawful for the landlord to require a pet deposit in excess of one month's rent, regardless of the duration of the rental agreement. A tenant should follow the same procedures for return of a pet deposit as for the return of a security deposit.&nbsp;Is the Landlord Allowed to Ask for an Application Fee?A landlord may charge an application fee to determine a tenant's credit worthiness. The application fee must not exceed the greater of either 10 percent of the monthly rent for the rental unit or $50.00. Upon receipt of an application fee, the landlord must give a receipt to the tenant and must keep records for at least two years. The tenant is entitled to double the amount charged as an application fee when the landlord unlawfully demands an application fee greater than the amount allowed under the Landlord-Tenant Code.&nbsp;What is the Purpose of the Security Deposit?The purpose of the security deposit is: (1) To reimburse the landlord for actual damages caused to the premises by the tenant which exceed normal wear and tear, or which cannot be corrected by painting and ordinary cleaning; and/or (2) To pay the landlord for all rental arrearage due under the rental agreement, including late charges and rent due for premature termination or abandonment of the rental agreement by the tenant; and/or (3) To reimburse the landlord for all reasonable expenses incurred in renovating and re-renting the premises caused by the premature termination of the rental agreement by the tenant.&nbsp;Are There Limitations on the Amount of Deposit?Where the rental agreement is for one year or more, or month to month tenancies that last one year or more, it is unlawful for the landlord to require a security deposit in excess of one month's rent. However, the landlord may require a security deposit in excess of one month's rent for a furnished rental unit, rental of certain federally-assisted housing and where the tenancy is expected to last less than one year.&nbsp;Is the Landlord Allowed to Increase the Amount of Deposit?A landlord may increase the security deposit along with an increase in rent if the rental agreement allows such increases. If the increase of the security deposit exceeds ten percent of the monthly rent, payment of the increased security deposit must be spread proportionately over the term of the rental agreement, except for month-to-month tenancies, in which case payment of the increase must be spread out over a period of four months.&nbsp;Where Does the Landlord Keep the Security Deposit?The landlord must place the security deposit in an escrow bank account in a federally-insured banking institution located in Delaware. If requested by the tenant, the landlord must disclose to the tenant the location of the security deposit account. If the landlord fails to disclose the location of the security deposit account within 20 days of a written request by the tenant, then the landlord loses the right to hold the security deposit and must refund it to the tenant within 20 days. The landlord also loses the right to hold the security deposit if the landlord fails to deposit the security deposit in a federally-insured financial institution located in Delaware. The tenant is entitled to double the amount of the security deposit if the landlord fails to return the full security deposit to the tenant within 20 days of forfeiture. Legal Services of Delaware can provide you with a form named Request For Location of Security Deposit which you can use to send a written request to your landlord to find out the location of your security deposit.&nbsp;How Do I Request the Return of the Security Deposit?The tenant should provide the landlord with a forwarding address in writing and a written request to return the security deposit before moving out of the rental unit. Legal Services of Delaware can provide you with a form named Request For Return of Security Deposit/Notice of Forwarding Address you can use to provide the forwarding address to your landlord. The landlord must provide the tenant with an itemized list of damages to the rental unit and must return within 20 days after the termination or expiration of the rental agreement, either the full security deposit or the difference between the security deposit and the amount of damages.&nbsp;How Do I Object to the Amount Withheld?If the tenant disagrees with the landlord's deductions from the security deposit, the tenant must object in writing to the itemized damages within 10 days of receipt of the landlord's itemized list of damages. If the tenant receives a check for a partial refund of the security deposit and objects to the deductions from the security deposit, the tenant should not cash or deposit the check in her bank account because it might prevent the tenant from recovering the full amount of the deposit. Instead, the tenant should promptly photocopy the check and send it back to the landlord along with a letter objecting to the amount withheld and requesting that the landlord return the full amount.&nbsp;How Do I File a Lawsuit to Recover the Security Deposit?A lawsuit for return of a security deposit is considered a debt action. A debt action is a claim for a sum of money - in this case, for the return of a security deposit. In order to begin a lawsuit, you must fill out a Complaint (J.P. Civil Form No. 1) and submit it, along with the filing fee, to the Justice of the Peace Court nearest your residence. The Justice of the Peace Court's  website has a Sample Complaint and Instructions for filing a Complaint for return of security deposit. On the website, open the Frequently Asked Questions page. Scroll down to the Brochures heading and open the Sample Civil Complaints page. You should also read the brochure How to File and Defend a Civil Case in the Justice of Peace Court of the State of Delaware. This brochure and the sample forms are on the website and also available at the Court. Legal Services of Delaware can also provide you with a copy of the brochure.If the tenant provides the landlord with a forwarding address in writing at or prior to the termination of the rental agreement, and the landlord fails to remit the security deposit, or the difference between the security deposit and the amount set forth in the list of damages, within 20 days from the termination of the rental agreement, then the tenant is entitled to seek double the amount wrongfully withheld. If the tenant is seeking double the amount wrongfully withheld, then the tenant should write the doubled amount in the Relief Sought section of the Complaint where it says ""amount of money claimed.""It is important to remember that the return of the security deposit is not automatic and usually requires some action by the tenant. To help ensure that the entire security deposit will be returned to the tenant by the landlord, the rental unit should be clean, completely vacated, and not have any damages caused by the tenant. If possible, the tenant should take pictures or a videotape before leaving to document the condition of the rental unit. It is also important for the tenant to give the landlord a forwarding address in writing before or at the time the tenant vacates the rental unit and to timely object to the landlord's deductions from the security deposit if the tenant disagrees with them. If a tenant believes that the landlord unjustifiably kept all or a portion of the security deposit, the tenant can file a lawsuit in the Justice of the Peace Court as outlined above.&nbsp;"274,http://www.lscd.com/node/300,Security Deposits and the Landlord-Tenant Code,"EvictionsLandlord/Tenant",,Housing,"The web page answers basic questions about security deposits  and the Delaware Landlord-Tenand Code.&nbsp;                                 Also available:                                                                          SecurityDeposit.pdf&nbsp;                                                          en espaÃ±ol  Contributed by: Legal Services Corporation of  Delaware, Inc.

Jack Markell.It was one of a package of bills aimed at helping homeowners through the growing foreclosure crisis.Under the new mediation law, foreclosure will be halted until a meeting takes place, though it include an opt-out provision. Lenders will pay a fee to finance the process, and the law will expire in two years.State Rep. John Kowalko, D-Newark South, said the stateâ€™s voluntary mediation program in place for more then a year hasnâ€™t done the job. He said having the program written into state law is going to make it more effective.â€œIt wasnâ€™t getting the numbers we wanted, and it wasnâ€™t really addressing any of the aspects, the potential for really resolving some of these,â€ù he said.Other bills Markell signed Wednesday will:&gt;&gt; Make lenders provide notice of foreclosure to borrowers and offer assistance.&gt;&gt; Require mortgage modification companies to be registered and bonded.&gt;&gt;Create a foreclosure office in the Attorney Generalâ€™s office to manage programs.&gt;&gt;Make filling a false document during a foreclosure proceeding carry a penalty of up to $10,000.Foreclosures are continuing to rise in all three Delaware counties, with at least 300 a month in New Castle and Sussex, more then triple during the same period a year ago. In Kent County there have been about 120 so far this month compared to about 90 in September 2010.â€œThis deals head-on with the foreclosure crisis weâ€™re facing in the state and nationally,â€ù Attorney General Beau Biden said about the package of bills. â€œThe goal is to at least have a meaningful conversation between the borrower and lender to see if there is something that can be done to avoid foreclosure.â€ùThe mediation law will take effect in four months. Kowalko said the state needed to get started on an outreach program to educate borrowers about the new process. He said he hoped Delawareâ€™s would be modeled after a successful initiative in Philadelphia.The stateâ€™s current mediation program is voluntary; about 85 people participated last year.&nbsp;View Article!Bills aim to help homeownersThursday, Sept. 22, 2011By Dan ShortridgeThe News Journal"356,http://www.lscd.com/node/389,Delâ€™s Aug. foreclosures are 12th worst in U.S.,Foreclosure,"foreclosureDelaware Foreclosure",Housing,"   &nbsp;The News JournalThurdsay Sept 22, 2011 &gt;&gt;Economy Delâ€™s Aug. foreclosures are 12th worst in U.S.Delaware is among the leaders, but not in a category of choice.The state had the 12th highest foreclosure rate in the nation in August, turning in the worst performance on the East Coast, according to RealtyTrac.

To do so, the landlord must first send you a letter stating that unless all of the rent due is paid, the landlord will terminate the lease and take you to court. The letter must set a deadline giving you at least 5 days to pay. This letter is often called a ""Five Day Letter.""Then, if you do not pay in full or move out by the deadline, the landlord can go to Justice of the Peace Court and file a case asking for the rent money and to have you evicted. Remember that the amount of money you owe could include late fees and back rent from previous months. The law allows the landlord to ask you to pay all of it or be taken to court."381,http://www.lscd.com/node/418,What happens when you violate a lease or landlord-tenant code,Landlord/Tenant,,Housing,"Most leases include rules and promises by the tenant.

To do so, the landlord must first give youa letter that does the following:explain what rule you have brokenand what you are doing wrong,give you at least 7 days to correct the problem (not 5 days as when rent is late),tell you that if the problem is not corrected by the deadline, the landlord may terminate the leaseand go to court to have you evicted,warn you that if the same rule is broken again within 1 year, the landlord can go directly to court without giving a new notice.If you do not fix the problem, or if you fix it and break the same rule again within 1 year, your landlord can&nbsp; take you to court to have you evicted.&nbsp; Please remember that this is only general information.&nbsp; It may not apply to your specific situation."382,http://www.lscd.com/node/419,Can a landlord evict me if I am convicted of a misdemeanor or felony?,,,Housing,"If you (or a family member living on the premises) is convicted of a class A misdemeanor or a felony while living in the house or apartment and the conduct that led to the conviction caused or threatened to cause irreparable (unfixable) harm to any person or property, the landlord can immediately terminate the lease and go to court for an eviction.

If you have a lease with an ending date, the landlord must tell you 60 days before the lease ends, in writing, that he will not be renewing the lease. Otherwise, after the ending date, it continues month to month.If the landlord has notified you that the lease will not be renewed, then you must move out by the last day of the lease.If you do not move out, then you are ""holding-over"" and the landlord can go to court and seek to have you evicted. The landlord does not need to give any additional warning or notices. The notice that the lease would not be renewed is enough.If you lose in court, the law says that you can be ordered to pay double your daily rent as a penalty until you move out."385,http://www.lscd.com/node/422,I just received an eviction notice.

He might want all his money immediately."393,http://www.lscd.com/node/431,Foreclosure in Delaware,Foreclosure,,Housing,"In Delaware, a mortgage is a lien against the property granted by the home owner to the lender to secure an obligation to pay the note. The note is a written promise to pay a debt (the loan).In this brochure, when we use the word mortgage, it will generally mean both the mortgage and the note. When you fail to make required payments on your mortgage, your mortgage will be in default. Once you are in default, the lender can start foreclosure proceedings, and you could lose your house if you have no defenses.You will probably receive notices from the lender and/or the court related to foreclosure. Some of the most common types of notice in Delaware are ""notice of default,"" ""notice of acceleration,"" ""writ of scire facias,"" and ""notice of sale"". If you receive any notices related to foreclosure, seek help from an attorney immediately."394,http://www.lscd.com/node/432,Type of Foreclosure Notices,Foreclosure,,Housing,"Notice of DefaultIf you fall behind in the payments on your mortgage, the lender will usually send you a ""notice of default"" or ""notice of delinquency"" telling you that your payments are behind. A notice of default is often required by the mortgage. However, Delaware law does not require notice of default unless the mortgage requires such notice.The notice of default warns you of a serious problem, so you must take action immediately. It may be possible to avoid foreclosure at this stage if you immediately call the Workout Department of your lender and offer to pay the full amount of back payments and current payments, or discuss some other type of workout agreement.Notice of AccelerationMany mortgages contain a paragraph that covers situations when you are in default or late on your payments. This paragraph is known as an ""acceleration"" clause because it allows the lender to accelerate, or push forward, the date that full payment on your mortgage is due. Some mortgage contracts require the lender to give ""notice of acceleration"" to the borrower.The ""notice of acceleration,"" sometimes called a ""demand letter,"" normally states that the whole balance is due and payable immediately. If you fail to pay the entire amount due, the lender has the right to foreclose on the mortgage. However, the lender must comply with the requirements of the loan documents and other relevant laws. So, it is important to seek advice from an attorney as soon as you receive a ""notice of acceleration."""395,http://www.lscd.com/node/433,Foreclosure Court Notices,,,Housing,"Writ of Scire FaciasIn Delaware, a lawsuit is required to foreclose on your mortgage except for certain types of mortgages issued by the government. The foreclosure process takes an average of 5 to 6 months from filing the lawsuit until the confirmation of the foreclosure sale.Don't be surprised if none of the papers in a foreclosure lawsuit actually use the word ""foreclosure."" Instead, the lawsuit papers will probably use the Latin words ""scire facias sur mortgage"" or ""sci fa sur mortgage."" If the foreclosure is in Superior Court, the Sheriff will serve you with a ""writ of scire facias"" (sci. fa.) at your residence.The sci. fa. has many papers including a Summons, Complaint, a certified copy of the mortgage, an Affidavit of Demand, a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act disclosure statement and a ""Notice to Lien Holders and Tenants of Filing of Action.""Within 10 days of filing the foreclosure lawsuit, the lender must send by certified mail a copy of the complaint and a ""Notice to Lien Holders and Tenants of Filing of Action"" to you and anyone with an interest in your property, such as your tenants and other lenders. The lender will also post this notice on the main door of your house.You must answer the complaint within 20 days after you are served with the complaint. For this reason, it is important to see an attorney as soon as possible, because, if you fail to answer within 20 days, or your answer does not meet other legal requirements, default judgment will be entered against you. Unless the default judgment is vacated or reopened, you will automatically lose your home.In Delaware, there will usually be a notation on the complaint that plaintiff demands that defendant answer the allegations of the complaint by affidavit pursuant to 10 del. C. Â§ 3901. This means that your answer to the complaint must include an affidavit of defense. Your affidavit of defense must give detailed and specific answers to all the allegations in the affidavit of demand, otherwise, the court may grant the lender's request for a default judgment and you would automatically lose the foreclosure lawsuit.Possible defenses to a foreclosure lawsuit are satisfaction or payment of the mortgage, or defenses that seek to avoid the mortgage, such as, assignment, discharge, duress, forfeiture, fraud, illegality, ratification, unjust enrichment and waiver.After you answer the complaint and affidavits, then the court will send you a Case Scheduling Order. It is important for you, or your attorney, to appear at the court on the dates scheduled and meet other deadlines listed on the Case Scheduling Order. The foreclosure lawsuit gives you a chance to appear before the court and present any defenses explaining why your house should not be taken and sold to satisfy the debt. If you fail to appear, default judgment will be entered against you and you will automatically lose your home.Notice of SaleIf you lose the foreclosure action or a default judgment is entered, the sheriff will issue notice of sale and sell your house at a public sale. Notice of sale must be delivered to you at least 10 days before the day of the sale. When you receive notice of sale you should contact an attorney before the sale date to discuss whether bankruptcy would be helpful for you. Advertisements will also be posted in local newspapers for 2 weeks before the sale. The sheriff will sell your house at a public sale usually located at the county courthouse.Confirmation of SaleTo complete the process on judgment of foreclosure, there is a confirmation hearing scheduled about 30 days after the Sheriff's Sale. If there are no objections to the confirmation of the sale, then the sheriff delivers a deed to the new owner who bought your house at the Sheriff's Sale."396,http://www.lscd.com/node/434,Foreclosure Prevention,"BankruptcyForeclosure",,Housing,"Right to cure a defaultYou can cure a default by paying the lender missed payments, plus fees and costs before acceleration of the mortgage. After acceleration of the mortgage, you may cure the default by paying the entire balance of all the principle, interest and costs due on the mortgage, but only if you do so before the Sheriff sells the property at the Sheriff's Sale. However, partial payments made after acceleration of the entire debt, evidenced by the initiation of foreclosure proceedings, do not cure the default. So the lender can refuse partial payments and continue with the foreclosure.RedemptionYou may exercise the right of redemption before the confirmation of the foreclosure sale. Redemption means that you pay off the entire balance owed on the loan plus the lender's foreclosure fees and costs. In general there is no right to redeem after the confirmation of the Sheriff's Sale. In Delaware, there is an exception that allows the owner to redeem within 60 days after the confirmation of Sheriff's Sale if the property was sold to collect delinquent county taxes.SaleYou may want to ask for a delay of the foreclosure sale so that you can negotiate a workout agreement with the lender. In some cases, the lender may agree to give you an opportunity to sell the property through a realtor rather than in the foreclosure process. A private sale may help avoid potential foreclosure losses.BankruptcyYou may want to consider preventing foreclosure by filing a chapter 13 bankruptcy. Filing bankruptcy automatically stops the foreclosure process. However, in certain circumstances, a creditor may ask the bankruptcy court to allow the lender to continue the foreclosure despite the bankruptcy.You have a right to cure a default on a mortgage if your chapter 13 plan is approved by the bankruptcy court. In the chapter 13 plan, you would most likely be required to pay your regular mortgage payments, plus an additional amount to get caught up during the length of the plan. If you want to file for bankruptcy protection, you should consult a bankruptcy attorney."397,http://www.lscd.com/node/435,What Happens After A Foreclosure Sale,Foreclosure,,Housing,"EvictionIf you are a tenant living in a property sold in a foreclosure sale, then the creditor or buyer must file a claim either for ejectment or possession to evict you. After a claim is filed, it can take as little as a couple of days, or as long as, a month or two before the tenant is forcecd to leave the rental property.After the foreclosure sale, you should prepare to move out. Although if you are unable to afford alternative housing, you could stay in the property until you get evicted. A lender can evict you by requesting a writ of possession from the Superior Court. The writ of possession allows the lender to evict you in a matter of weeks. It is served by a Sheriff. A buyer, unlike a lender, must file a claim for ejectment in the Superior Court to evict you. A buyer cannot file the claim for ejectment until after the deed is transferred to the buyer. Usually, the ejectment process takes months and is much slower than the writ of possession.Deficiency ClaimsThe original owner is entitled to any surplus of the sale proceeds, after the mortgage, interest and costs of foreclosure are paid. However, if the sale proceeds do not pay off the existing mortgage on the property plus costs and the foreclosure lawsuit did not sue on both the mortgage and note, then the lender must file a separate lawsuit on the note to obtain a deficiency judgment. A deficiency judgment is a final court ruling in favor of a creditor for the balance of the debt, interest and costs that are not paid off by the sale of the real estate. If the court grants a deficiency judgment against you, then you would have an obligation to pay the amount of the judgment to the lender."400,http://www.lscd.com/node/439,Trespass Action - Justice of the Peace Interactive Form,Housing,,Housing,"This is an online interview that guides you through&nbsp;completing a JP Court form for a trespass action. &nbsp;The filer is asked&nbsp;questions relating to his or her claim, and using the answers to these&nbsp;questions, the program automatically fills in the JP Court form,&nbsp;including the statement of facts. &nbsp;The interview process is simple and&nbsp;easy to complete. &nbsp;Upon completion, a document ready to be filed in&nbsp;court can be printed out by the litigant for submission to the court.&nbsp;You do not have to sign up to use it, you can simply select the ""go'&nbsp;button and start. &nbsp; However, if you sign up, you will be able to stop&nbsp;working on your form and go back to it at a later time.To use this&nbsp;form, you must have Internet Explorer 6 or higher.

Unemployment Compensation is a form of insurance which pays money to       workers between jobs. Unemployment Compensation is paid to workers who       qualify under the law. To file for Unemployment Compensation, report to       the nearest State of Delaware Department of Labor. &nbsp; Am I Eligible for Unemployment Compensation? Four standards must generally be met to qualify for benefits:   You must be unemployed through no fault of           your own.  You must be able to work, available for work           and actually seeking employment.  You must be registered to work with the           Delaware State Employment Service.  You must have been paid a minimum amount of           wages during a set period of time prior to applying for benefits.  &nbsp; What Are the Reasons That I Can Be Disqualified from       Receiving Benefits? Some of the most common reasons for disqualification from receipt       of benefits are:  Quitting a job voluntarily without good cause connected with work. Being discharged/fired from work for just cause. Refusing an offer of suitable work for which the claimant is           reasonably suited. Refusing a referral to a suitable job opportunity offered by the           State employment service.  &nbsp; What Are the Steps in Determining Whether a Worker Is       Eligible for Benefits?   A discharged/fired worker files a claim.  The Department of Labor sends a form to the worker's former           employer.  The employer returns the form to the Department of Labor listing the           reason for the worker's termination of employment.  A Department of Labor ""Claims Deputy"" decides whether the           worker is eligible for benefits.  &nbsp; How Do I Appeal a Determination That I Am Ineligible       for Benefits?   An appeal from a Claims            Deputy's decision must be filed within 7 calendar days after delivery           of the decision or within 10 calendar days after the mailing date of           the decision. The Claims Deputy's decision is final if no appeal if           filed.  If an appeal is filed, a           hearing is scheduled to be heard by an ""Appeals Referee.""            All evidence, including witness testimony and written documents should           be presented at this hearing. If a witness will not appear           voluntarily, or written documents cannot be obtained, the worker can           request a subpoena compelling the attendance of a witness or the           production of documents. The Appeals Referee will then hear the           testimony, review the written evidence and later issue a written           decision.  The Appeals Referee's           decision may be appealed to the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, a           five-member panel. An appeal from an Appeal Referee's decision must be           made within 10 calendar days of the mailing of the decision. The Board           may limit review to the evidence presented to the Appeals Referee,           however, at the Board's discretion, additional testimony, documents           and arguments may be considered.  &nbsp; How Do I Appeal a Determination from the UI Appeal       Board?  A decision of the UI Appeal Board must be appealed to the Superior           Court within 10 calendar days of its mailing, or it becomes final. The           Court will not consider any evidence which was not presented at the           lower appeal levels. The Department of Labor will submit a record to           the court which will include copies of all documents submitted in the           case and a written transcript of the witnesses testimony. The court will then, generally, schedule written and/or oral           arguments, and after the arguments are presented a judge will issue a           written decision. The decision of the Superior Court Judge can then be           appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court, however this is not common.  &nbsp; Department of Labor offices New Castle County: Department of Labor 4425 North Market Street Wilmington, DE 19849             (302) 761-8446 Department of Labor Pencader Courtyard Route 896 Newark, DE 19714 (302) 368-6600 Kent County: Sussex County: Department of Labor 114 South Dupont Highway, Suite 103 P.0.

Many people supplement their income in a very easy way. Let us tell you how...Ads like these can be found in         newspapers and magazines in every American city. While you may find such         offers appealing, especially if you can't work outside your home,         exercise caution. While some work-at-home plans are legitimate, many are         not. Home employment schemes are among the oldest kinds of classified         advertising fraud. Many ads don't say that you may have to work many hours without pay.         Or that there may be hidden costs. Countless work-at-home schemes         require you to spend your own money to place newspaper ads; make         photocopies; or buy the envelopes, paper, stamps, and other supplies or         equipment you need to do the job. The companies sponsoring the ads also         may demand that you pay for instructions or materials. Consumers         deceived by these ads have lost thousands of dollars, in addition to         time and energy.&nbsp; Common Work-at-Home         Schemes Several types of employment are classic work-at-home schemes. Envelope stuffing. Promoters usually advertise that,         for a ""small"" fee, they will tell you how to earn money         stuffing envelopes at home. Later-when it's too late-you find out that         the promoter never had any employment to offer. Instead, for your fee,         you're likely to get a letter telling you to place the same         ""envelope-stuffing"" ad in newspapers or magazines, or to send         the ad to friends and relatives. The only way you'll earn money is if         people respond to your work-at-home ad. Assembly or craft work. These programs often require         you to invest hundreds of dollars in equipment or supplies. You also may         be required to spend many hours producing goods for a company that has         promised to buy them. For example, you might have to buy from the         company a sewing or sign-making machine or materials to make such items         as aprons, baby shoes or plastic signs. However, after you've purchased         the supplies or equipment and performed the work, fraudulent operators         don't pay you. In fact, many consumers have had companies refuse to pay         for their work because it didn't meet ""quality standards."" Unfortunately, no work is ever ""up to standard,"" leaving         workers with relatively expensive equipment and supplies-and no income.         To sell their goods, these workers must find their own customers.&nbsp; Exercise Caution Legitimate work-at-home program sponsors should tell you-in         writing and for free-what's involved. Here are some questions you might         ask a potential employer: What tasks will I be required to perform? (Ask the program sponsor             to list every step of the job.) u Will I be paid a salary or will my             pay be based on commission? Who will pay me? When will I get my first paycheck? What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including             supplies, equipment and membership fees? What will I get for my             money?  The answers to these questions may help you determine whether a         work-at-home program is legitimate, guarding you against financial loss. You also might want to check out the company with your local consumer         protection agency, state Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau         both where the company is located and where you live. These         organizations can tell you whether they have received complaints about         the work-at-home program that interests you.&nbsp; Where To Complain If you have spent money and time in a work-at-home program and         now believe the program may not be legitimate, contact the company and         ask for a refund. Let company representatives know that you plan to         notify officials about your experience. If you can't resolve the dispute         with the company, here are some organizations that may be able to help         you: The Attorney General's office in your state or the state where the             company is located. The office will be able to tell you whether             you're protected by any state law that may regulate work-at-home             programs. Your local consumer protection offices. Your local Better Business Bureau. Your local postmaster. The U.S. Postal Service investigates             fraudulent mail practices. u The advertising manager of the             publication that ran the ad. The manager may be interested to learn             about the problems you've had with the company. &nbsp; For More Information The FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and           unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide           information to help consumers spot, stop and avoid them.

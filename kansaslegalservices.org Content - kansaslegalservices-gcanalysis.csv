History

During the 1920s and 30s, the American Bar Association recognized the need for special&nbsp;assistance to the poor by creating a committee on legal aid. State and local bar&nbsp;associations worked over the following decades to promote legal aid societies to offer&nbsp;free legal services to the poor.

Early legal services supporters accepted that the pledge of ""Equal Justice Under the&nbsp;Law"" cannot be realized as long as people with limited resources do not have access to&nbsp;the justice system.

In the mid-1960s and 70s, legal aid societies were formed in Topeka, Wichita and Kansas City.

From the 1960s until 1974, the three Kansas legal aid societies ran under the authority&nbsp;of the Office of Economic Opportunity, Office of Legal Services. Power for the legal&nbsp;services program was transferred to the newly formed Legal Services Corporation

during 1975.

Through all of these changes in administrative authority and funding, the Kansas legal&nbsp;aid societies continued to supply free legal services to the poor in Kansas.

In 1977, the Kansas City, Topeka and Wichita legal aid societies merged to form&nbsp;Kansas Legal Services, Inc.

Kansas Legal Services now has eleven legal services and two&nbsp;mediation services offices located across the state. It also&nbsp;maintains a wide retainer contract system with assistance from members of the Kansas Bar&nbsp;Association.

Please review our Annual Reports for more details about our programs and activities.

Before You Call&nbsp;

Is your problem a civil legal problem?&nbsp;Our Central Intake Unit will help you find out if there are free or low cost options for you.


	For example, we have no free service for criminal or traffic issues. &nbsp;
	There is never a cost to call, however, to see what low cost options might be offered for your unique situation.


Don‚Äôt wait to call&nbsp;

Many legal problems are made worse when people delay getting help. It is also easier for lawyers to prepare any necessary documents the more time you give them.

Get your documents and facts together before you call

The services on hand vary widely based on each caller's unique situation. The more specific and correct the info you can give, the more we will be able to give the best guidance possible.

How To Use An Attorney As You Represent Yourself In Court

Adapted from a document prepared by the Supreme Court Committee on Self Represented Litigants (6/25/08)

&nbsp;

What is limited scope representation?

Limited scope representation means that you and your attorney agree that you will do some of the tasks related to your case, and the attorney will do others.&nbsp;

For example, you may agree that you will gather the financial data while the attorney drafts the paperwork to be filed with the court. The attorney may coach you on how to prepare documents yourself or review documents you have drafted. &nbsp;The attorney may coach you on how to appear in court by yourself. They may handle only the most complex parts of your case and give you advice on how to handle the simpler parts. &nbsp;The attorney may prepare the evidence which you will present at court. The attorney can also appear at court for one part of your case (the most difficult or technical) while you represent yourself on other simpler or less critical parts. &nbsp;The attorney then bills you only for the parts of the case the attorney handled.

What kinds of cases work best for limited representation?

Family law cases are often well suited for limited representation.

The best cases are not very technical, but are slow and take a lot of time. Because you pay for an attorney‚Äôs time, the best solution is the one which makes the most effective use of that time. &nbsp;


	For example, if you know you will be waiting at the courthouse all morning for a few minutes of court time. In that case, it may not be the best use of your&nbsp;trial&nbsp;budget to pay an attorney to wait with you. &nbsp;You may instead want to spend the attorney‚Äôs time being coached on how to best represent yourself, and then appear by yourself in court. &nbsp;That way you aren‚Äôt incurring legal fees while you wait for your case to be called. &nbsp;


The other cases which work well are those with few issues. Another kind is where there is only one technical issue which can be split, part for the attorney to handle while you handle the simpler issues.

What kinds of questions should I be asking?

You and your attorney should have a thorough discussion about all the aspects of your case and agree on your respective duties. &nbsp;Among the issues you should discuss are:


	Who will set a strategy?
	Who will gather info? &nbsp;Who will prepare that info for the court?
	Who will draft documents for the court?
	Who will appear at court and settlement conferences?
	Who will negotiate with the opposing party to try to settle out of court?
	How do I benefit?


There may be many things you can do to help with your own representation. &nbsp;For example, you may be able to gather much of the needed info yourself so you don‚Äôt have to pay the attorney to do it. The attorney can then take that info and put it in a form which is useful to the court. In this way, you make the most efficient use of the attorney‚Äôs time (and your&nbsp;lawsuit&nbsp;budget) by focusing the attorney‚Äôs time on things you can‚Äôt do well yourself. &nbsp;By doing this, you will not only save money on legal fees, but have greater control of your case than if the attorney handles the whole process.

What are the trade-offs?

Your attorney went to law school and probably has years of experience in this field. &nbsp;You don‚Äôt. &nbsp;That means that he/she will know things that you don‚Äôt about the legal process. &nbsp;If you instruct your attorney not to take certain steps, either to save money or because you want to stay in control, the outcome in the parts of the case you do yourself will be your responsibility, even with an attorney coaching you. &nbsp;There may be hidden snags in your case that you aren‚Äôt aware of because you don‚Äôt have legal training. &nbsp;That is why you must be careful to discuss your legal matter thoroughly with your attorney.

Be sure you are at ease handling the parts of your case that you take on. Make sure that you aren‚Äôt taking on anything which is too technical.

Why shouldn‚Äôt I just go to a paralegal service or document preparer?

While many paralegals have experience drafting simple documents, they have not been to law school.&nbsp; One of the common problems people face is that a case which appears simple actually has hidden complications that someone who is not legally trained will not be able to spot.&nbsp;

After reviewing your case with you, an attorney may recommend that you do use a paralegal, if he/she feels the issues are straightforward. &nbsp;However, if you don‚Äôt consult with an attorney first, you won‚Äôt know if possibly serious complications have been ignored. &nbsp;

Also, a paralegal won‚Äôt be able to represent you in court or negotiate a settlement with the other side.

Why shouldn‚Äôt I just keep coming back to the Lawyer Referral Service for a new referral each time a question comes up in my case?

That is not in your best interest. &nbsp;If you keep consulting with different attorneys on your family law case, you have to introduce each new attorney to all that has happened before. &nbsp;


	This means that you waste time (that you are paying for) getting the attorney up to speed on your legal matter. &nbsp;
	It also increases the risk that you forget to tell the attorney some facts from the past which are important to your current question. &nbsp;


You are much better off consulting with the same attorney over a period of time as new questions come up. They will be familiar to you and with what has come before in the case.

How do I know if it won‚Äôt work in my case?

This is why it is important to thoroughly discuss your case with an attorney, including areas which you intend to handle yourself. &nbsp;There are often issues which you are not aware of. &nbsp;If you don‚Äôt discuss the whole case with the attorney, even the parts that you think are simple and intend to handle yourself, you may have missed something that is legally important. &nbsp;Once you have had this discussion, you and the attorney can agree on who will be handling which issues and you can feel good knowing that you‚Äôve learned of any hidden issues.

If you have a hard time dealing with the other party, keeping track of paperwork, or speaking in a stressful setting like court, it is important to get help in these areas from an attorney.&nbsp;

Will the courts let me do this?

Yes. &nbsp;The courts want to encourage people to get as much legal assistance as they need to effectively protect their rights. &nbsp;


	Because the courts can‚Äôt give legal advice, this means that they want you to have access to as much legal help as you need. &nbsp;
	They know that you‚Äôll do a better job of presenting the important info to them if you have been coached on what info is helpful to the courts and how it can be most effectively presented.&nbsp;
	
		They may suggest that you get added help from an attorney if they think you need more help.
	
	


What happens if I need more services from the attorney at a later date?

New issues often come up in family law matters. &nbsp;That means that you may find you need more assistance from the attorney than you first expected. &nbsp;If you use limited scope, you can always go back to the attorney and ask for more help. Your attorney will already be familiar with you and your case because of his or her having taken part already. &nbsp;This will be much more efficient than trying to find another attorney to help you and then having to educate that person about your case. &nbsp;

Remember, you are paying for your attorney‚Äôs time, so it is very wasteful to keep paying new attorneys to learn about your legal issues.

What if I decide I want the attorney to handle the entire case?

After going to court on your own, even with good coaching from an attorney, you may decide that you‚Äôd rather have the attorney take over the whole case. Because you pay any attorney for their time, it is always more efficient to return to the attorney who already knows you and your legal issues. &nbsp;It would cost you more to pay a new attorney to get up to speed.

What if my&nbsp;spouse&nbsp;has a lawyer and I have a coach?

Many people decide that they would rather represent themselves, even if the other side has a lawyer. &nbsp;Your coach, or limited scope lawyer, can prepare you for what to expect in court. They can advise you of your legal rights and the most effective way to protect them, and outline possible negotiation strategies for you. &nbsp;Your attorney can also negotiate for you to try to settle the case outside of court, even though you intend to represent yourself in court if the negotiations fail.

What if the attorney doesn‚Äôt want to do what I ask?

You and your attorney are working as a team, but it is your case. &nbsp;While the attorney has much more experience in legal matters than you do, the ultimate decision is always yours. &nbsp;

If your attorney feels strongly that the course you want to take isn‚Äôt in your best interests, you should listen carefully to the reasons why he/she is recommending you do something different. &nbsp;However, the ultimate decision and burden is yours. You have the right to disregard your attorney‚Äôs advice. But, if the case doesn‚Äôt turn out the way you hoped, you have to be willing to accept the responsibility for your decision.

What if I am afraid of my&nbsp;spouse?

If you are afraid of your&nbsp;spouse, be sure to discuss your fears with your attorney. &nbsp;

While there are security systems at the courthouse, both at the entrance and in the courtrooms, you may not be feel at ease appearing in court alone. In that case, you may decide to do more of the legwork yourself, and have the attorney appear in court with you.&nbsp; These are all options which are open to you.

What other resources are out there to help me represent myself? &nbsp;Will the attorney tell me where to look for self-help legal resources?&nbsp;

Yes, the attorney will likely tell you where to look to find tools to help you assist in your own representation. &nbsp;There are many good resources out there.&nbsp;

You can access info on the Kansas Bar Association website at&nbsp;www.ksbar.org&nbsp;and there are a number of local bar associations and local district courts which have info on their websites.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In January, 2008, Kansas Legal Services implemented the Family Health Care Legal Services Clinic in partnership with the University of Kansas Law School and the Southwest Boulevard Family Health Clinic in Kansas City, Kansas. The clinic served patients living in some of the poorest areas of the community. The goal of the partnership was to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable individuals, children and families by integrating legal assistance into the medical setting.

In 2009, Kansas Legal Services implemented two more Medical-Legal Partnerships. With funding from the Sunflower Foundation and in partnership with the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, the Southeast Kansas Medical-Legal Partnership began on June 1, 2009, in Pittsburg and formally ended in 2013.

In August, 2009, the Kansas-Focused Medical-Legal Partnership for was implemented in partnership with Children‚Äôs Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, funded by the Greater Kansas City Health Care Foundation. &nbsp;KLS staff provide legal assistance to persons using the health center‚Äô services who are referred by a medical staff member.

In 2010, KLS started&nbsp;the North Central Kansas Medical Legal Partnership at the&nbsp;Wamego Community Health Ministry Clinic and the&nbsp;the Konza Prairie Community Health Center in Junction City, a project funded by the Sunflower Foundation.&nbsp;

In March, 2011, KLS opened the Southwest Kansas Medical-Legal Partnership. The project activities are focused on residents of Southwest Kansas who use either the United Methodist Mexican-American &nbsp;Ministry Health Clinics or Area Mental Health Centers. The clients of the health clinic are predominantly Hispanic, many speaking Spanish as&nbsp;their primary language. This location was selected because&nbsp;it represents a very rural area, dependent on these providers as the only available health care resources. Both clinics must provide services beyond health care because of the needs of the population. The Sunflower Foundation funded the project.&nbsp;

The relationship between poverty and ill-health is many times&nbsp;bi-directional: poverty contributes to ill health and ill health contributes to poverty. &nbsp;Individuals and families must have their basic needs met in order to be healthy and achieve their potential. When basic needs are not met, poor health outcomes occur. &nbsp;

Health is dependent on the social well-being of the family -- and many times health relies on legal along with medical remedies. For example, a child may have asthma that is exacerbated by moldy walls in a house. KLS staff working with a landlord to clean up the problem will positively affect the child's health.

The medical-legal partnerships rely on the collaboration between health care professionals and legal staff. &nbsp;Healthcare staff is trained to screen clients for possible legal issues and refer clients to legal staff. &nbsp;Legal issues may be as simple as advice or more complex, such as representation.

Pro Se
Legal Assistance",Attorneys / Legal Services,"From November 17, 2014 Kansas City Star&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By Roxie Hammil &nbsp;&nbsp;SPECIAL TO THE STAR

&nbsp;

Let‚Äôs be clear: Going to the courthouse to file paperwork has never been anybody‚Äôs idea of a good time.

Yet one area of the Johnson County Courthouse has become known to clerks as a place with ‚Äúthe highest number of hugs per square foot‚Äù of any courthouse office.

That area is a new help center designed to ease the frustration of people who are trying to go it without an attorney in divorces, child visitation arrangements and evictions.

People can represent themselves in family law cases

That‚Äôs a fair amount of cases, according to Johnson County District Court officials. Last year, for example, some 620 new divorce, paternity and custody/support cases were filed by people who either did not want or couldn‚Äôt afford lawyers.

Usually, a case involves multiple filings for such things as adjustments to visitation rules, support payments and hearing date requests. In the past, that meant searching out the right forms online or from the courthouse law library and other offices, said Sandy McCurdy, clerk of district court.

That often proved frustrating and overwhelming to people who weren‚Äôt familiar with how the legal system works, she said. And it made more work for the clerks when forms weren‚Äôt filled out correctly.

In May, the county‚Äôs judges, clerks and court staff set up a small center with three computer terminals to help people navigate the filings. That first month, 116 people used the center. Last month the center moved into a bigger space on the first floor that had been vacated by the sheriff‚Äôs department. That month, the volume had nearly tripled to 334 people served, said District Court Judge Keven O‚ÄôGrady.

Clerks at the center figure they see about a dozen clients a day, with about 1,300 seen since May.

One in five divorces with children involve people without a lawyer

The numbers may increase with the county‚Äôs population. About a third of divorce cases without children and one in five with children involve people who are not represented by a lawyer.

Often, those people are stressed out by the experience, O‚ÄôGrady said. Divorce itself is already one of life‚Äôs most stressful events, he said. ‚ÄúPile on top of that the stress of dealing with a very unfamiliar system and things can be overwhelming,‚Äù O‚ÄôGrady said.

People who come in for hearings without the proper paperwork could be sent back to redo them, adding to lost time for them and court employees, he said. ‚ÄúWe can work people through faster if we only have to do it once,‚Äù O‚ÄôGrady said.

The center has the potential to save clients money as well as time, said McCurdy. For example, some people looking for legal help online end up paying hundreds of dollars for packets of forms issued in other states that may not be applicable in Kansas.

Court officials were able to set up the center without adding staff, O‚ÄôGrady said. Clerks take turns working at the front desk. Others work in their help session between regular clerk duties.

KLS attorneys on-site on Tuesdays and Fridays to help

The clerks can help people fill out the forms, but can‚Äôt give advice about what to put on them or what legal strategy to take. However, people who meet the financial guidelines can get that kind of help from Kansas Legal Services attorneys on Tuesdays and Fridays in small rooms at the center.

The help center is modeled after a similar program in the Bronx. There are only a few others in the country. McCurdy believes it to be the first such center in Kansas.

The center adds a little more work for the clerk staff, but many find it rewarding. Clients are grateful for the information, which even includes printed advice on what to expect and how to dress in a courtroom.

‚ÄúThe clients are definitely very appreciative of any kind of help you can give,‚Äù said Melissa Mercer, trial court coordinator. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs saving everybody frustration. People are in better moods and we‚Äôre in better moods.‚Äù

Said Teresa Young, supervisor of the help center, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rewarding. It makes you feel good. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve had anybody walk away from here upset or mad.‚Äù

Center may expand to other types of cases

Eventually the center may expand its services to other non-criminal cases, such as collections or guardianship and conservator reports, said O‚ÄôGrady.

In the meantime, the center is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays when the courthouse is open. &nbsp;Click here to learn more about the Help Center.

372,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1927,Legal aid funding generates serious economic returns,Attorneys/Legal Services,"legal aid
benefits of legal aid
legal services corporation
civil legal assistance",Attorneys / Legal Services,"By Sam Wright. Above the Law, &nbsp;Mar 31, 2015&nbsp;

Civil legal aid is sometimes seen as little more than a drain on public resources. You don‚Äôt have to take my word for this ‚Äî earlier this month, in pushing an amendment to the House budget bill that would defund the Legal Services Corporation (the major funder of legal aid in the United States), U.S. Representative Alex Mooney (R-WV)&nbsp;contributed the following statement&nbsp;to the Congressional record: ‚ÄúTo cut Federal waste, my third proposal defunds the Legal Services Corporation‚Ä¶ Defunding this organization would remove a Federal agency operating outside of its mandate and would also save taxpayers millions of dollars.‚Äù

This statement is mostly wrong. LSC is not a federal agency ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚Äúa private nonmembership nonprofit corporation.‚Äù And in my experience, LSC does not act outside its mandate by a longshot.&nbsp;When I worked for an LSC-funded organization, I screened clients for their immigration status, I withdrew from representing clients who went to prison, and as a general rule affirmative advocacy was not an option.&nbsp;All this was because LSC takes its federally mandated funding strings seriously.

But Rep. Mooney‚Äôs statement does contain a kernel of truth: defunding LSC would save taxpayers millions of dollars ‚Äî at least, if we only take costs into account and not benefits.&nbsp;It‚Äôs worth asking, then, what these benefits are.&nbsp;What do taxpayers actually get in return for their multimillion dollar investment in LSC?

What do taxpayers get in return for funding legal aid?

Luckily for us, there‚Äôs now an answer (albeit a state-specific one). And it‚Äôs not just something along the lines of ‚Äúa slightly more just society‚Äù (although that‚Äôs not a bad return in itself).&nbsp;

Rep. Mooney proposed defunding LSC on March 17, and on March 18 the Tennessee Bar Association let us know why that would be a terrible idea by&nbsp;releasing a detailed report&nbsp;about the perhaps surprisingly large economic returns generated by investing in legal aid.

The report is titled ‚ÄúEconomic Impact of Civil Legal Aid Organizations in Tennessee‚Äù and concludes that the $16.83 million invested in legal aid in Tennessee in 2013 generated $188.60 in positive economic impacts, for an overall economic return of $11.21 per dollar invested.&nbsp;That seems pretty good to me. And it actually makes intuitive sense, too, if you look independently at some of the categories of benefits that result from this spending.

In particular, a full $33.8 million of those economic impacts (about 18%) are attributable to foreclosure prevention. &nbsp;Foreclosures are famously costly ‚Äî they end up harming borrowers, harming lenders, harming neighbors by reducing their property values, and harming municipalities by reducing property tax collections. Preventing them is obviously a public good, and the Tennessee Bar Association report gives us numbers to support that conclusion. Indeed, if the report‚Äôs numbers are correct then foreclosure prevention alone not only offsets the cost of&nbsp;all&nbsp;legal aid provided in Tennessee but in fact provides a 2-to-1 return.

Getting victims out of abuse saves lives and over ten thousand dollars per victim per year

A smaller but still significant portion of these positive economic impacts come from another obvious social benefit: domestic-violence prevention.&nbsp;Get a victim out of an abusive situation and you save not only possibly a life but also the costs of ‚Äúmedical treatment, counseling, police protection, and other support‚Äù valued at over ten thousand dollars per victim per year, for a total savings of $7.5 million.

Unsurprisingly, the Tennessee Bar Association‚Äôs&nbsp;press release&nbsp;announcing the report includes a gentle call for increased funding for civil legal aid:

‚ÄúIncreasing funding and support for civil legal services should create additional benefits.‚Äù&nbsp;

This seems reasonable enough.&nbsp;After all, legal aid generates economic returns as a function of clients served, and the pool of potential legal aid clients out there far exceeds the current capacity of legal aid organizations to represent them (recall the&nbsp;justice gap.)&nbsp;

More funding will support more legal aid lawyers who can represent more clients, and the result will be still greater economic returns. And this actually&nbsp;turns out to be perhaps the strongest reason Rep. Mooney is wrong.&nbsp;If we want to grow the economy we need&nbsp;more&nbsp;investment in legal services ‚Äî not less.

Johnson County",Attorneys / Legal Services,"Kansas Legal Services - Kansas City is very grateful to the Board of Trustees of the Johnson County Bar Foundation for awarding us a very generous contribution for the second year. The funding allows us to provide attorney time, supervision and support time to the Johnson County Help Center, located in the Johnson County Courthouse.

At the Help Center, clients involved in family law and eviction cases can locate, fill out and file the necessary papers and forms in one location. Qualifying individuals may obtain limited legal assistance from Kansas Legal Services staff on-site two days per week.&nbsp;

The Help Center is designed mostly to assist those who cannot afford an attorney in family law cases and in eviction cases.&nbsp;

KLS-KC works closely with the Johnson County District Court Clerks at the Help Center. The Court Clerks obtain information from applicants and send KLS-KC staff the applications. Potential clients are screened and if they are eligible, they are given an appointment to see KLS-KC staff. &nbsp;KLS staff are on-site on Tuesdays or&nbsp;Fridays from 9:30 a.m. through 3:30 p.m.

The rest of the week, the Court Clerks provide valuable information on the legal process. The Clerks may also point out the legal forms needed for persons who want to ""do it themselves"" at the Help Center.

There are always opportunities for interns or pro bono attorneys to participate. This includes retired/inactive attorneys working pro bono through KLS.&nbsp;

free legal services",Attorneys / Legal Services,"In 2012, the White House and the U.S. Department of Justice&nbsp;launched the Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (Roundtable) to raise Federal agencies‚Äô awareness of how civil legal aid can help low income people.

Ways the Federal agencies can help include:


	Making it easier for low income persons and their families to get healthcare and housing, good education and better employment.
	Helping people with their family stability and helping communities with community well-being.


Providing legal help to people who cannot afford it can also help stop outcomes that would be harmful to them and costly for the larger society.&nbsp;

This article is adapted from a ""tool kit"" that the Roundtable is providing online for legal services to use. The tool kit gives ideas on how to educate people about civil legal aid and what it can do for them.

What is Civil Legal Aid?

Civil Legal Aid is free legal assistance to low- and middle-income people who have civil legal problems. These problems are non-criminal. That means that civil legal aid helps people get basic needs met such as health care, housing, government benefits, employment, and educational services.&nbsp;

How can Civil Legal Aid help me and my family?

The types of legal help you can get through civil legal aid programs (like Kansas Legal Services) include:

‚Ä¢ Meeting basic&nbsp;needs including government benefits and disaster services (SNAP, School Lunch Program, SCHIP, TANF, SSI, disability, veterans, FEMA); housing (loans to repair, foreclosure, eviction, unsafe housing, subsidized housing benefits); and health care (Medicaid, Medicare, Affordable Care Act).&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Making sure you and your family are safe&nbsp;and stable which includes&nbsp;individual safety (domestic violence, stalking or other harassment, elder abuse, child abuse and neglect); family law (child support, adoption, guardianship, divorce); and keeping children and youth in school (student discipline hearings, accommodations).&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Supporting individuals‚Äô security including jobs (the right payment for work performed, safe working conditions, securing drivers/professional licenses, accommodations for people with disabilities); taxes (filing and getting low-income tax credits); and consumer protection (consumer fraud and scams, predatory lending, unfair debt collection practices and managing debt).

What type of services does Civil Legal Aid provide?

Civil Legal Aid refers to both free legal advocacy and legal information for low- and middle-income people to help solve the civil legal problems they may face.

This aid can take many forms, including:

‚Ä¢ Direct services by legal aid attorneys and pro bono volunteers such as legal representation in court, and legal advice to help identify legal issues and possible solutions.

‚Ä¢ Finding solutions to problems faced by a large number of people. This may take looking at deep-seated problems and gathering information to figure out how to solve the problems.

‚Ä¢ Self-help and community education for people through workshops, telephone help lines, medical/legal partnerships, online information and chat tools, and downloadable court forms. &nbsp;These things help people understand their rights and responsibilities, when legal aid may be needed and where to find it, and get assistance with self-representation when necessary.&nbsp;

398,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1974,Obama establishes the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable,Attorneys/Legal Services,,Attorneys / Legal Services,"This was released by the White House on September 24, 2015:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

SUBJECT: Establishment of the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to increase the availability of meaningful access to justice for individuals and families and thereby improve the outcomes of an array of Federal programs, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Policy. This Nation was founded in part on the promise of justice for all. Equal access to justice helps individuals and families receive health services, housing, education, and employment; enhances family stability and public safety; and secures the public's faith in the American justice system. Equal access to justice also advances the missions of an array of Federal programs, particularly those designed to lift Americans out of poverty or to keep them securely in the middle class. But gaps in the availability of legal aid -- including legal representation, advice, community education, and self-help and technology tools -- for America's poor and middle class threaten to undermine the promise of justice for all and constitute a crisis worthy of action by the Federal Government.

The majority of Americans who come to court do so without legal aid. They may be left by their economic circumstances to face life-altering events -- such as losing a home or custody of children, or escaping domestic violence or elder abuse -- on their own. More than 50 million Americans qualify for federally funded civil legal aid, but over half of those who seek assistance are turned away from legal aid organizations, which lack the funds and staff to meet the demand.

When people come into contact with or leave the criminal justice system, they are likely to face a range of legal issues. A victim of abuse may need a protective order, or a formerly incarcerated individual may need a driver's license reinstated in order to get a job. Access to legal aid can help put people on a path to self-sufficiency, lead to better outcomes in the civil and criminal justice systems, and enhance the safety and strength of our communities. Increased legal resources in a community can also help courts process cases more effectively and more efficiently, saving time and money.

Federal programs that are designed to help the most vulnerable and underserved among us may more readily achieve their goals if they include legal aid among the range of services they provide.

By encouraging Federal departments and agencies to collaborate, share best practices, and consider the impact of legal services on the success of their programs, the Federal Government can enhance access to justice in our communities.

&nbsp;

The organization provides legal advice, representation to thousands of Kansans


Marilyn Harp, state director of Kansas Legal Services, says the organization provides legal advice and representation to low-income Kansans. KLS has 11 offices statewide and 30 attorneys, with retired attorneys volunteering their time as well.

Every now and then, someone gets entangled wrongfully in the legal system. In criminal cases, the public defender‚Äôs office steps in if you can‚Äôt afford an attorney. But if you‚Äôre the injured party or the case isn‚Äôt determined to be criminal, getting legal help if you‚Äôre at the lower end of the financial spectrum may feel like you‚Äôre hitting one brick wall after another.

That‚Äôs where Kansas Legal Services may be able to help. KLS provides legal services for people who would otherwise find it impossible to have access to the legal system based on their income, according to executive director Marilyn Harp, who recently spoke by telephone about the organization.

Q: Why is it important to have an organization such as Kansas Legal Services?

Harp: The U.S. Constitution has been interpreted to include the right to an attorney for someone charged in a criminal case. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre familiar with the Miranda Rights. The right to an attorney does not extend to people who are involved in civil cases ‚Äî people who may be involved in child custody disputes or for people facing foreclosure of their home.

Of course, we can‚Äôt provide services to everyone in Kansas facing those situations because we have limited resources, but we help as many as we can.

Q: You mentioned child custody disputes and foreclosure situations. What are some of the other situations KLS would likely become involved in?

Harp: We do a large amount of family law work, with a huge focus in helping the victims of domestic violence or sexual assault without consideration of their income. We assist in a number of identity theft or Social Security disability cases for people disabled applying for Social Security benefits. Much of that work is with people who only qualify for SSI (Supplemental Security Income) benefits. In addition, we provide advice or guidance to people representing themselves who need access to information ‚Äî in consumer cases, landlord tenant concerns, those kinds of things. Or, perhaps they need legal forms. They can also find many of those legal documents on our website.

Q: So people who are economically disadvantaged and senior citizens are your primary clients?

Harp: Right. If you‚Äôre in the state Supreme Court building, there‚Äôs a quote on the wall that says, ‚ÄúWithin these walls, the balance of justice weighs equal.‚Äù The goal of what we do is to really play out the idea of access to justice, that all people are equal within the justice system.

Q: What‚Äôs your average annual caseload?

Harp: Annually, we probably talk to and provide legal advice for 10,000 Kansans and provide legal representation in court to another 8,000 or 9,000 people. That being said, the need is probably four times that many. We have 11 offices statewide and 30 attorneys and, again, limited funding.

In the past year, we have received requests for legal assistance for 4,413 families (in Shawnee, Douglas, Jefferson, Osage and Wabaunsee counties) and have been able to provide legal services to 1,842 of those families.

Q: With that volume, I would imagine you would encourage other lawyers in Kansas to volunteer some time?

Harp: Absolutely, whether they‚Äôre still practicing law or retired. We do have retired lawyers who volunteer. One notable one is former Kansas Sen. Tim Owens. He volunteers his services two days a week in our Johnson County office. Even if an attorney is retired and hasn‚Äôt maintained a license to practice, they can still volunteer under our supervision.

Q: How can someone reach out to you for help?

Harp: They can call our statewide toll-free number, or they can apply online at the KLS website.

One thing I want to mention is that the American Bar Association has started a new project in many states ‚Äî I think about 40 states now, including Kansas ‚Äî where volunteer attorneys provide web-based, free legal answers.

Some people don‚Äôt require legal representation, they just need an answer to a question. Those people can go to freelegalanswers.org. If you do need more than answers, contact Kansas Legal Services.

The program, hosted by the American Bar Association in partnership with the Kansas Bar Association, launched&nbsp;https://Kansas.freelegalanswers.org&nbsp;in the fall of 2016.&nbsp;The service expands legal services for those who cannot afford an attorney. Users have to meet eligibility guidelines in Kansas.

Civil legal questions (up to three per year) may be put online and users will get an answer via email.

The site is always available online and open to receive questions 24/7. &nbsp;All questions asked on&nbsp;ABA Free Legal Answers&nbsp;are protected by attorney-client privilege.

The free virtual legal advice model began in Tennessee and was adopted by the American Bar Association to take nationwide. The program is supported by a long list of organizations and is a project of the ABA Standing Committee on Pro Bono and Public Service.&nbsp;

Along with giving legal advice, the program gives attorneys an opportunity to give back through volunteering.

Marilyn Harp, member of the KBA Access to Justice Committee and Executive Director of Kansas Legal Services, said:


‚ÄúMany Kansans do not have access to information about how laws apply to their own lives. We appreciate the work of the Kansas Bar Association and volunteer attorneys who are working to expand this valuable new approach in Kansas. The resource is a good companion to the forms and education currently available on the Kansas Legal Services website (www.kansaslegalservices.org). Making free legal answers available virtually nationwide will be helpful to a great many people.‚Äù


Eligibility requirements

When you go to the website, you will fill out an application to find out if you are eligible for free services. &nbsp;Generally, you can use this website IF all of these are true for you:

Your income is low for a family the size of yours

Your cash, checking account, savings account, stocks or bonds are not worth too much.

You aren't locked up in jail or prison.

Your legal problem isn't something you can go to jail for.

You haven't already hired a lawyer to help you with your legal problem.

The site application asks questions to make sure you meet these rules. You must tell the truth.

If you don't meet the rules you can't use the freelegalanswers.org website.

But, if you can't meet the rules, staff of the site will tell you if they know another place where you might get help.

If you agree to the rules of the website

Clicking the ""Agree"" button means:

You read and understand the rules.

You agree to tell the truth and give all the information you know about your legal problem.

You agree to post only&nbsp;three questions&nbsp;about&nbsp;three legal problems&nbsp;in any calendar year.

You will not create a new account to ask additional questions.

If you don't agree with these rules, you may not use this website.

About the lawyers

The lawyer who answers your question is helping you for free. The lawyer will only talk about the problem you put on the website. The lawyer will not help you after that or do anything else for you.

The lawyer will not make calls or file papers for you. The lawyer will not go to meetings or to court for you.

If you use this website, it means you understand this. The lawyer who answers your legal question will be legally authorized to practice law in the state where you live. The lawyer will say what the law is for the state where you live. Laws may be different in other states.

&nbsp;

If you need answers to a legal problem in another state, you can see if that state is participating in this program by going here:&nbsp;http://freelegalanswers.org/

What is mediation?

Mediation&nbsp;is a voluntary process in which a trained mediator aids discourse and negotiation between people in dispute. The goal of&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;is to reach an agreement that settles the dispute in a jointly pleasing manner. Mediations are conducted at a neutral location and in an informal and safe environment.

During the&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;process, all parties are given the chance to share their thoughts and feelings about the matter in dispute. With the mediator, all persons jointly create an agenda, isolate the issue in dispute, define each person‚Äôs interests and create an agreement.

Benefits of Mediation


	Mediation&nbsp;is neutral. Mediators do not act as advocates, give any opinion or decide how the dispute should be resolved. The mediator does not assess fault or take sides.
	Participants control the outcome. Individuals involved in&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;create their own agreement. The mediator's role is to help develop a realistic, workable solution that takes every person‚Äôs thoughts and feelings into consideration.
	Mediation&nbsp;is private. Kansas law (with some exceptions) makes mediations confidential. All notes made by mediators are destroyed after an agreement is reached. No party can subpoena&nbsp;the mediator and no info specific to the&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;is allowed in court.
	Mediation&nbsp;can resolve issues quickly.&nbsp;Mediation&nbsp;can resolve disputes in a matter of days as opposed to months or years it may take in regular legal proceedings.
	Mediation&nbsp;can preserve relations.&nbsp;Mediation&nbsp;can help build a positive framework for future dealings between persons.&nbsp;Mediation&nbsp;also models problem solving, listening and negotiation skills that can help parties long term.
	Mediation&nbsp;gets results. Depending on the type of dispute, between 40% and 80% of disputes taken to&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;result in agreement.


How Do I Access Mediation Services?

KLS provides&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;in a wide variety of cases. These include: insurance disputes, special education, employment discrimination, public accommodations, juvenile dependency and domestic matters such as custody and visitation. We receive referrals for&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;from local district courts, the Kansas Human Rights Commission and others. KLS also offers fee based mediations on a sliding scale.

KLS Mediation Programs

Access to Justice Mediations (ATJ) are funded by the Office of Judicial of Administration under the direction of the Kansas Supreme Court. ATJ funding enables persons with fitting incomes to receive our mediation&nbsp;services at no charge. Often ATJ mediations involve domestic matters such&nbsp;as&nbsp;custody and visitation, as well as Child in Need of Care (CINC) cases.

Kansas Legal Services contracts with the Kansas Human Rights Commission (KHRC) to offer willing mediation&nbsp;to disputants involved in employment, housing, and public accommodation complaints filed with the KHRC. Matching funds for this program are provided by the IOLTA Program.

Kansas Legal Services accepts referrals of domestic, civil or juvenile disputes from judges, attorneys, agencies and the general public. These are accepted on a sliding for-fee basis whenever other funding sources do not apply.

Please read the instructions carefully before filing your answer with the court.

&nbsp;

Instructions for Filing an Answer in a Limited Action case

1. Do NOT file the first 3 instruction pages with the Court.

2. Complete the form by replacing the labels for information (surrounded by &lt; &gt; symbols) with your information.&nbsp; Make sure to erase the &lt; &gt; symbols once you have entered your info.


	For example, where it says &lt;Filer‚Äôs name&gt;, put in your name.
	Some areas don‚Äôt have &lt; &gt; symbols, but rather a blank line. In the example below, Case No. is followed by a blank line. That is where you would insert your case number. Make sure you have entered all the needed data.


3. Put in the information from the Petition in the upper part (known as the caption).&nbsp; Put the Plaintiff‚Äôs name in exactly as it is listed, etc.&nbsp; This is only used to identify the case.&nbsp; Copy the case number from the Petition.&nbsp;


	Example:


‚Äã

4. Complete paragraph 1 with a very brief statement of why you deny the truth of the Plaintiff‚Äôs Petition.


	Remember that failure to state your defense may result in judgment being taken against you.


5. Read the instructions below to determine if you need to put anything in paragraph 2.


	Generally, a defendant is only required to ‚Äúdeny‚Äù the truthfulness of a Plaintiff‚Äôs statement in order to create a situation where the Plaintiff must prove the statement in a trial.&nbsp;
	However, Kansas law requires certain things to be stated affirmatively as defenses to a law suit.&nbsp; Those things are set out in KSA 60 -208( c) and are listed here:



(c)‚ÄÉAffirmative defenses.&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;In general.&nbsp;In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including:

(A)‚ÄÉAccord and satisfaction;

(B)‚ÄÉarbitration and award;

(C)‚ÄÉassumption of risk;

(D)‚ÄÉcontributory negligence or comparative fault;

(E)‚ÄÉduress;

(F)‚ÄÉestoppel;

(G)‚ÄÉfailure of consideration;

(H)‚ÄÉfraud, illegality;

(I)‚ÄÉinjury by fellow servant;

(J)‚ÄÉlaches;

(K)‚ÄÉlicense;

(L)‚ÄÉpayment;

(M)‚ÄÉrelease;

(N)‚ÄÉres judicata;

(O)‚ÄÉstatute of frauds;

(P)‚ÄÉstatute of limitations; and

(Q)‚ÄÉwaiver.



	Most of these are technical legal terms that may require additional research, if you believe one applies to your situation.&nbsp;
	If you believe one or more than one of these things applies in your situation, you must state it in paragraph 2.&nbsp; Otherwise, you may leave paragraph 2 blank.


6. In the Certificate of Service area, put in the address for the Plaintiff or Plaintiff‚Äôs attorney that is listed on the Petition.&nbsp;


	You are required to mail a copy of your Answer to that address along with filing a copy of the Answer with the Clerk of the District Court.


7. Sign the Answer in two places: At the bottom of the ANSWER section and at the bottom of the CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE section.&nbsp;


	You will need the original and at least 2 copies of the Answer.


8. Mail a copy of your answer to the Plaintiff (or Plaintiff‚Äôs attorney, if represented). &nbsp;


	Put the date you mail the copy of your answer in the Certificate of Service section on both the copy you mail and on the original you will file with the Court.

367,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1918,Civil legal assistance  helps people escape poverty,Poverty,,Civil Procedure / Administrative Law,"By Lonnie Powers &nbsp; &nbsp;Posted on TalkPoverty, January, 2015

&nbsp;

Sargent Shriver, President Johnson‚Äôs personal choice to lead the War on Poverty, was once asked which anti-poverty program he considered the most important.

‚ÄúMy favorite is Head Start because it was my idea,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúBut I am proudest of Legal Services because I recognized that it had the greatest potential for changing the system under which people‚Äôs lives were being exploited.‚Äù

Legal aid fights poverty

Legal services, also known as civil legal aid, has indeed been a potent anti-poverty tool in two ways.

First, through individual casework that enables poor people to gain access to the rights and benefits from state and federal service agencies, health care providers, and schools to which they are entitled.

Second, through large, class-action lawsuits and advocacy efforts that change laws and governmental policies that adversely‚Äïand overwhelmingly‚Äïaffect poor people.

War on Poverty Anniversary

With the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty in 2014, we have been treated to numerous assessments of the effectiveness of Johnson‚Äôs (and Shriver‚Äôs) landmark program. Tremendous progress has been made and much work remains.

To continue progress, civil legal aid must be deployed more broadly in future efforts to combat poverty, and public resources for legal assistance must be increased greatly.

Successful class action lawsuits

With regard to class action lawsuits, we have seen how civil legal aid has resulted in significant legal victories.

In 1970, legal aid attorneys successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in Goldberg v. Kelly that state welfare departments cannot terminate benefits without first providing applicants with a fair hearing.

In 1973, California Rural Legal Assistance successfully sued to stop large agricultural operators from requiring migrant farm workers to use short-handled hoes while working in fields.

The short-handled hoes forced workers to stay bent over for long periods of time. Field managers required their use because if they saw workers standing up, then they knew that they were resting and not working.&nbsp; After these hoes were banned, back injuries among farm workers dropped by more than 30 percent. )

More recently, a federal lawsuit by Greater Boston Legal Services resulted in changes in policy by the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance which had improperly denied benefits to people living with disabilities.

Legal aid for homeless issues

A look at how civil legal aid casework for individuals struggling with homelessness and/or unstable housing, as well as those who are victims of intimate partner violence, is also instructive.

Numerous programs around the country demonstrate that civil legal services can help poor people keep their housing, or negotiate exits from housing that prevent immediate evictions, and ensure a smooth transition to safe, affordable housing.

A pilot program launched in 2009 by the Boston Bar Association showed conclusively ‚Äãthat poor people fighting eviction notices in housing court in Quincy, Massachusetts fared much better when they were represented by attorneys.

Two-thirds of those with full representation kept their housing.&nbsp; Only one-third of those who went through housing court without an attorney were able to do the same. Similar results have been found in New York City, San Francisco, and San Mateo County in California.

Legal aid helps women escape abuse

A landmark 2003 study published in Contemporary Economic Policy showed that legal services is one of the most effective ways to help women living in poverty escape intimate partner violence.

Amy Farmer and Jill Tiefenthaler, researchers at the Carnegie Mellon Census Research Data Center, were intrigued by a U.S. Department of Justice report noting that rates of domestic violence had significantly declined during the 1990s.

The researchers analyzed data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and the U.S. Census to tease out the reasons for the improvement. Their conclusion? Access to civil legal services ensured delivery of protective orders; assistance with child custody and support; and divorce and property distribution that victims needed to begin rebuilding their lives.

Civil legal assistance was also critical for resolution of domestic violence-related legal disputes around immigration, housing, and public benefits.

While services provided by emergency shelters, counselors, and hotlines are vital in the short-term, Farmer and Tiefenthaler wrote, services provided by civil legal aid ‚Äúappear to actually present women with real, long-term alternatives to their relationships.‚Äù

It is also interesting to note that between 1994 and 2000, the period during which incidents of domestic violence declined, the availability of civil legal services for victims of domestic violence increased 245 percent‚Äîfrom 336 such programs in 1994 to 1,441 in 2000.

Many don‚Äôt know what legal aid is

Despite these clear successes, many people do not understand what civil legal aid is, and surveys regularly find that most Americans erroneously believe that poor people have a right to free counsel in civil cases. Meanwhile, state and federal funding for legal assistance is well below what it needs to be.

This fall, the Boston Bar Association‚Äôs Statewide Task Force to Expand Civil Legal Aid in Massachusetts released Investing in Justice, a report showing that more than 60 percent of those who are eligible for civil legal aid in Massachusetts and seek services are turned away due to lack of resources.

The Task Force proposed that the Commonwealth‚Äôs investment in civil legal aid be increased by $30 million over the next three years to begin to address the unmet need. Currently, the state invests $15 million annually in civil legal aid.

Legal aid pays for itself and then some

Civil legal aid yields a measurable‚Äïand significant‚Äïreturn on investment.

Looking at work solely related to housing, public benefits, and domestic violence, three independent economic consulting firms found that every dollar spent on civil legal aid in eviction and foreclosure cases saved the state $2.69 on services associated with housing needs.

Every dollar spent assisting qualified people to receive federal benefits brings in $5 to the state.

Every dollar spent on civil legal aid related to domestic violence is offset by a dollar in medical costs averted due to fewer incidents of assault.

Person in poverty testified before Congress

This summer, Philadelphia resident Tianna Gaines-Turner became the first person actually living in poverty to testify before Congressman Paul Ryan‚Äôs Congressional hearings on the War on Poverty.

In her strong and moving testimony, Ms. Gaines-Turner spoke of the need for increased state and federal funding to end poverty, saying, ‚ÄúPeople living in poverty‚Äïthose who were born into it, and those who are down on their luck‚Äïwant to get out of poverty. We want to create our own safety nets, so we never have to depend on government assistance again.‚Äù

Civil legal aid is a powerful tool.&nbsp; It helps people living in poverty build a foundation of stability so they can create a better future for themselves, their families, and our communities.

This guide is meant to help people going to court for either a PFA (Protection From Abuse) or a PFS (Protection From Stalking).

It is divided into 3 pages/parts:


	Preparing for your PFA/PFS
	Going to Court for your PFA/PFS
	After Court- What to Do Now?


You are now on Part 2:&nbsp;Going to Court for your PFA/PFS.


‚ñ∫&nbsp;Please be sure to read ALL THREE parts of this guide to make sure you are as prepared as possible going into court.

‚ñ∫&nbsp;It is also VERY important to read part 3 after court and safety plan to make sure you remain safe, no matter the outcome of your court date.


PFA Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 2/3: Going to Court for Your PFA/PFS

Come early to docket


	There is a whole check in process you will need to go through. You will also need to factor time to find signs for the court number, etc.


Turn off your phone or put it on silent


	You don‚Äôt want your ringer going off while someone is talking.
	Do not text or answer a phone call in court. If the Judge sees you on your phone they will ask you to leave.




What to do when your case is called


	Stand, don‚Äôt stay seated. Speak clearly and audibly when making your presence known.
	Come to the front of the divider when your case is up and stand at the desks in front of the judge.
	
		One desk is for plaintiffs (the person who filed the case) and the other is for defendants (the person against whom the case is filed).
	
	


Show respect to the judge and the court


	Address the judge as ‚ÄúYour Honor‚Äù and listen closely to their instructions and explanations.
	Do not interrupt the judge. Ever.


Be aware of your body language in court


	Avoid rolling your eyes or interrupting while the other side talks.
	
		Even if what they are saying is wrong or they are lying, it‚Äôs their time to talk. You‚Äôll get your chance to tell the judge what you think when it‚Äôs your turn.
	
	




When you are in front of the judge, avoid talking directly to your opponent


	All comments and arguments should be to the judge and not include any side conversations with your opposing party.


How docket works/ Flow of events




	Make sure you write down the date of your court appearance in your calendar. Make arrangements for childcare and transportation.
	
		BE THERE, and be there on time.
	
	
	First, you will need to check in with the clerk at the courtroom door. The clerk will mark you present on their sheet and let you know which side of the room to sit on.
	
		In PFA and PFS cases, defendants and plaintiffs sit on opposite sides of the room.
	
	
	When the judge comes into the room, you will be asked to ‚Äúall rise‚Äù. Stand when you hear that. Then the judge will let you know when you can sit back down.
	The judge will then go through the docket list to see who is present and who is not. This makes the docket list shorter by eliminating the cases that have no one present.
	
		Make sure you state that you are there when your name is called.
	
	
	In most counties, the judge will then start with represented cases. Those are cases for which the people have hired attorneys.
	When your case is called, come to the front of the divider separating the main seating area (called the ‚Äúgallery‚Äù) and the trial area. Stand at your table (plaintiff or defendant) in front of the judge.
	Listen carefully to what the judge says and asks. This will direct you as to what you need to do next.
	If you want to enter something into evidence or approach a witness or the judge, you must first ask permission from the judge.
	
		Say something like ‚ÄúYour Honor, may I approach the witness?‚Äù Then wait to hear the judge‚Äôs answer before acting.
	
	
	Once the case is dealt with for the day (whether it be continued to another date, dismissed, or resolved and a court order issued), you will need to wait for the clerk to give you your papers before you leave the courtroom.
	
		You need these documents for your files. They tell you what was decided that day.
		Make copies of the documents and keep them in a safe place.
	
	
	Make sure you and the opposing party leave at different times.
	
		If you feel unsafe walking to your car, ask the sheriff for an escort. They will usually provide you with one.
	
	
	Make sure to keep safety planning. This is an important step that can help ensure your safety.
	
		It‚Äôs also a good idea, if you haven‚Äôt already, to get in touch with the advocates at one of the domestic violence resource centers above. They can help heal the internal wounds many victims struggle with.
	
	
	If your case was continued to another date, make sure to write it down in your calendar and plan to be there.
	
		Make arrangements for childcare and transportation. You don‚Äôt want to have the case dismissed because you didn‚Äôt show up.
	
	


Clerks


	The clerk's office is where you go to file things in the courthouse. They usually close at 4, so keep that in mind.
	They also have several forms available and can make copies of documents at a small charge.


Safety first


	You can be escorted to your car by police officers if you don‚Äôt feel safe. Just ask!


&nbsp;

Reminders:


	Make sure you get a copy of your order before leaving the courthouse.
	Be sure to check out part 3 of this guide after your court date for safety planning steps.

Safety planning


	KLS has written a pamphlet specifically about safety planning in regards to PFA actions.
	
		It can be accessed at http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/184/pfa-safety-planning
	
	
	Please review the Safety Planning handout before completing the PFA forms provided by the courts.
	
		It may be hard to think about some of the aspects relating to safety planning. They do, after all, have something to do with avoiding your abuser. But having a plan makes taking action easier in the event something happens. It‚Äôs always good to be prepared.
		If you have kids, make sure to share your plan with them if they are involved.
		Share your plan with the necessary people, like who you would call if you were in trouble, or where you would stay.
		Be one step ahead!

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies ‚Äî Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion ‚Äî to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. The FCRA promotes the accuracy and privacy of information in the files of the nation‚Äôs consumer reporting companies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation‚Äôs consumer protection agency, enforces the FCRA with respect to consumer reporting companies.&nbsp;

A credit report includes information on where you live, how you pay your bills, and whether you‚Äôve been sued or arrested, or have filed for bankruptcy. Nationwide consumer reporting companies sell the information in your report to creditors, insurers, employers, and other businesses that use it to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, employment, or renting a home.

Here are the details about your rights under the FCRA and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act, which established the free annual credit report program.

Q: How do I order my free report?

A:&nbsp;The three nationwide consumer reporting companies have set up a central website, a toll-free telephone number, and a mailing address through which you can order your free annual report.

To order, visit&nbsp;annualcreditreport.com, call 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The form is on the back of this brochure; or you can print it from&nbsp;ftc.gov/credit. Do not contact the three nationwide consumer reporting companies individually. They are providing free annual credit reports only through&nbsp;annualcreditreport.com, 1-877-322-8228, and Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

You may order your reports from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies at the same time, or you can order your report from each of the companies one at a time. The law allows you to order one free copy of your report from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.

A Warning About ‚ÄúImposter‚Äù Websites

Only one website is authorized to fill orders for the free annual credit report you are entitled to under law ‚Äî annualcreditreport.com. Other websites that claim to offer ‚Äúfree credit reports,‚Äù ‚Äúfree credit scores,‚Äù or ‚Äúfree credit monitoring‚Äù are not part of the legally mandated free annual credit report program. In some cases, the ‚Äúfree‚Äù product comes with strings attached. For example, some sites sign you up for a supposedly ‚Äúfree‚Äù service that converts to one you have to pay for after a trial period. If you don‚Äôt cancel during the trial period, you may be unwittingly agreeing to let the company start charging fees to your credit card.

Some ‚Äúimposter‚Äù sites use terms like ‚Äúfree report‚Äù in their names; others have URLs that purposely misspell annualcreditreport.com in the hope that you will mistype the name of the official site. Some of these ‚Äúimposter‚Äù sites direct you to other sites that try to sell you something or collect your personal information.

Annualcreditreport.com and the nationwide consumer reporting companies will not send you an email asking for your personal information. If you get an email, see a pop-up ad, or get a phone call from someone claiming to be from annualcreditreport.com or any of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies, do not reply or click on any link in the message. It‚Äôs probably a scam. Forward any such email to the FTC at&nbsp;spam@uce.gov.

Q: What information do I need to provide to get my free report?

A: You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.

Q: Why do I want a copy of my credit report?

A: Your credit report has information that affects whether you can get a loan ‚Äî and how much you will have to pay to borrow money. You want a copy of your credit report to:


	make sure the information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date before you apply for a loan for a major purchase like a house or car, buy insurance, or apply for a job.
	help guard against identity theft. That‚Äôs when someone uses your personal information ‚Äî like your name, your Social Security number, or your credit card number ‚Äî to commit fraud. Identity thieves may use your information to open a new credit card account in your name. Then, when they don‚Äôt pay the bills, the delinquent account is reported on your credit report. Inaccurate information like that could affect your ability to get credit, insurance, or even a job.


Q: How long does it take to get my report after I order it?

A:&nbsp;If you request your report online at annualcreditreport.com, you should be able to access it immediately. If you order your report by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, your report will be processed and mailed to you within 15 days. If you order your report by mail using the Annual Credit Report Request Form, your request will be processed and mailed to you within 15 days of receipt.

Whether you order your report online, by phone, or by mail, it may take longer to receive your report if the nationwide consumer reporting company needs more information to verify your identity.

There also may be times when the nationwide consumer reporting companies receive a high volume of requests for credit reports. If that happens, you may be asked to re-submit your request. Or, you may be told that your report will be mailed to you sometime after 15 days from your request. If either of these events occurs, the nationwide consumer reporting companies will let you know.

Q: Are there any other situations where I might be eligible for a free report?

A: Under federal law, you‚Äôre entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You‚Äôre also entitled to one free report a year if you‚Äôre unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you‚Äôre on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud, including identity theft. Otherwise, a consumer reporting company may charge you up to $10.50 for another copy of your report within a&nbsp;
12-month period.

To buy a copy of your report, contact:


	Equifax:1-800-685-1111;&nbsp;equifax.com
	Experian: 1-888-397-3742;&nbsp;experian.com
	TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800;&nbsp;transunion.com


Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports.

Q: Should I order a report from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies?

A:&nbsp;It‚Äôs up to you. Because nationwide consumer reporting companies get their information from different sources, the information in your report from one company may not reflect all, or the same, information in your reports from the other two companies. That‚Äôs not to say that the information in any of your reports is necessarily inaccurate; it just may be different.

Q: Should I order my reports from all three of the nationwide consumer reporting companies at the same time?

A: You may order one, two, or all three reports at the same time, or you may stagger your requests. It‚Äôs your choice. Some financial advisors say staggering your requests during a 12-month period may be a good way to keep an eye on the accuracy and completeness of the information in your reports.

Q: What if I find errors ‚Äî either inaccuracies or incomplete information ‚Äî in my credit report?

A:&nbsp;Under the FCRA, both the consumer report¬≠ing company and the information provider (that is, the person, company, or organization that provides information about you to a consumer reporting company) are responsible for correcting inaccurate or incomplete information in your report. To take full advantage of your rights under this law, contact the consumer reporting company and the information provider.

Consumer reporting companies must investigate the items in question ‚Äî usually within 30 days ‚Äî unless they consider your dispute frivolous. They also must forward all the relevant data you provide about the inaccuracy to the organization that provided the information. After the information provider receives notice of a dispute from the consumer reporting company, it must investigate, review the relevant information, and report the results back to the consumer reporting company. If the information provider finds the disputed information is inaccurate, it must notify all three nationwide consumer reporting companies so they can correct the information in your file.

When the investigation is complete, the consumer reporting company must give you the written results and a free copy of your report if the dispute results in a change. (This free report does not count as your annual free report under the FACT Act.) If an item is changed or deleted, the consumer reporting company cannot put the disputed information back in your file unless the information provider verifies that it is accurate and complete. The consumer reporting company also must send you written notice that includes the name, address, and phone number of the information provider.


	Tell the consumer reporting company, in writing, what information you think is inaccurate.
	Tell the creditor or other information provider in writing that you dispute an item. Many providers specify an address for disputes. If the provider reports the item to a consumer reporting company, it must include a notice of your dispute. And if you are correct ‚Äî that is, if the information is found to be inaccurate ‚Äî the information provider may not report it again.


Q: What can I do if the consumer reporting company or information provider won‚Äôt correct the information I dispute?

A: If an investigation doesn‚Äôt resolve your dispute with the consumer reporting company, you can ask that a statement of the dispute be included in your file and in future reports. You also can ask the consumer reporting company to provide your state¬≠ment to anyone who received a copy of your report in the recent past. You can expect to pay a fee for this service.

If you tell the information provider that you dispute an item, a notice of your dispute must be included any time the information provider reports the item to a consumer reporting company.

Q: How long can a consumer reporting company report negative information?

A: A consumer reporting company can report most accurate negative information for seven years and bankruptcy information for 10 years. There is no time limit on reporting information about crimi¬≠nal convictions; information reported in response to your application for a job that pays more than $75,000 a year; and information reported because you‚Äôve applied for more than $150,000 worth of credit or life insurance. Information about a lawsuit or an unpaid judgment against you can be reported for seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out, which¬≠ever is longer.

Q: Can anyone else get a copy of my credit report?

A: The FCRA specifies who can access your credit report. Creditors, insurers, employers, and other businesses that use the information in your report to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, em¬≠ployment, or renting a home are among those that have a legal right to access your report.

Q: Can my employer get my credit report?

A:&nbsp;Your employer can get a copy of your credit report only if you agree. A consumer reporting company may not provide information about you to your employer, or to a prospective employer, without your written consent.

Your Access to Free Credit Reports

La Ley de Informe Justo de Cr√©dito (Fair Credit Reporting Act, FCRA) requiere que, a su pedido, cada una de las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores a nivel nacional ‚Äî Equifax, Experian y TransUnion ‚Äî le provea cada 12 meses una copia gratuita de su informe de cr√©dito. La ley FCRA promueve la exactitud y privacidad de la informaci√≥n contenida en los registros de las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s. La Comisi√≥n Federal de Comercio (Federal Trade Commission, FTC), la agencia nacional de protecci√≥n del consumidor, es la encargada de dar cumplimiento a la ley FCRA en lo que se refiere a las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores.

Un informe de cr√©dito contiene informaci√≥n sobre su lugar de residencia, la manera en que usted paga sus facturas y si usted ha sido demandado, arrestado o se ha declarado en bancarrota. Las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores a nivel nacional venden la informaci√≥n contenida en su informe a otorgantes de cr√©dito, aseguradores, empleadores y otros negocios que utilizan dicha informaci√≥n para evaluar sus solicitudes de cr√©dito, seguro, empleo o alquiler de viviendas.

A continuaci√≥n se presentan los detalles sobre los derechos conferidos a los consumidores por las leyes federales de Informe Justo de Cr√©dito FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act, FCRA) y de Transacciones de Cr√©dito Justas y Exactas (Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, FACT), las cuales establecen el programa informes de cr√©dito gratuitos anuales.

P. ¬øC√≥mo puedo solicitar mi informe gratuito?

R.&nbsp;Las tres compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s han establecido un sitio Web, una l√≠nea telef√≥nica de acceso gratuito y un domicilio postal centralizados a trav√©s de los cuales usted puede solicitar su informe de cr√©dito anual gratis.

Para solicitar su informe de cr√©dito, visite annualcreditreport.com, llame al 1-877-322-8228 o complete el formulario llamado Annual Credit Report Request Form y env√≠elo por correo a: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. El formulario se encuentra en la parte posterior de este folleto; si lo desea, tambi√©n puede imprimirlo desde&nbsp;ftc.gov/credito. No tome contacto individualmente con cada una de las tres compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s. Estas compa√±√≠as solamente suministran informes de cr√©dito gratuitos a trav√©s de annualcreditreport.com, 1-877-322-8228 y Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

Usted puede solicitar sus informes a las tres compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s al mismo tiempo, o bien puede ped√≠rselo solamente a una de las compa√±√≠as por vez. La ley le otorga el derecho de solicitar una copia gratuita a cada una de las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores cada 12 meses. La solicitud de su informe de cr√©dito anual gratis debe ser hecha en ingl√©s.

Advertencia sobre Sitios Web Impostores

Existe solamente un sitio Web autorizado para responder a las solicitudes del informe de cr√©dito anual gratuito que le concede la ley ‚Äîannualcreditreport.com. Los dem√°s sitios Web que dicen ofrecer ‚Äúinformes de cr√©dito gratuitos‚Äù, ‚Äúcalificaciones de cr√©dito gratuitas‚Äù o ‚Äúmonitoreo de cr√©dito gratuito‚Äù no forman parte del programa de informes de cr√©dito gratuitos anuales requerido por ley. En algunas ocasiones el ‚Äúproducto‚Äù gratuito viene con algunas obligaciones ‚Äúescondidas‚Äù. Por ejemplo, algunos sitios Web lo inscriben para recibir un servicio supuestamente ‚Äúgratuito‚Äù que se convertir√° en un servicio pago cuando expire el per√≠odo de prueba. Si usted no cancela el servicio durante el per√≠odo de prueba, puede estar dando su consentimiento para que la compa√±√≠a comience a facturarle cargos a su tarjeta de cr√©dito.

Algunos de estos sitios Web ‚Äúimpostores‚Äù incluyen en sus nombres t√©rminos tales como ‚Äúinforme gratuito‚Äù; otros establecen domicilios URL escribiendo intencionalmente&nbsp;annualcreditreport.com&nbsp;con faltas de ortograf√≠a con la esperanza de que usted escriba incorrectamente el nombre del sitio oficial en la barra de domicilio del navegador. Algunos de estos sitios ‚Äúimpostores‚Äù lo dirigen a otros sitios Web en los cuales intentar√°n venderle algo o recoger su informaci√≥n personal.

Ni el sitio annualcreditreport.com ni las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s le enviar√°n un e-mail solicit√°ndole su informaci√≥n personal. Si recibe un e-mail, ve en Internet un anuncio de tipo por-up o recibe una llamada en supuesta representaci√≥n de annualcreditreport.com o de alguna de las tres compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores, no responda ni haga clic sobre ning√∫n v√≠nculo o enlace contenido en el mensaje. Probablemente se trate de una estafa. Reenv√≠e este tipo de mensajes electr√≥nicos a la FTC:&nbsp;spam@uce.gov.

P. ¬øCu√°l es la informaci√≥n que debo proporcionar para obtener mi informe gratuito?

R.&nbsp;Es necesario que usted proporcione su nombre, domicilio, n√∫mero de Seguro Social y fecha de nacimiento. Si usted se ha mudado durante los √∫ltimos dos a√±os, es posible que tenga que informar su domicilio previo. Con el fin de mantener la seguridad de su registro, cada compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores puede pedirle alg√∫n otro dato que solamente usted conozca, como por ejemplo el monto del pago mensual de su hipoteca. Cada compa√±√≠a puede solicitarle diferentes datos ya que la informaci√≥n contenida en su registro puede provenir de diferentes fuentes.

P. ¬øPor qu√© raz√≥n deber√≠a tener inter√©s en obtener una copia de mi informe de cr√©dito?

R.&nbsp;Su informe de cr√©dito contiene informaci√≥n que afecta su posibilidad de obtener un pr√©stamo ‚Äî y lo que tendr√° que pagar para tomar dinero prestado. Es importante que usted se interese en ver su informe de cr√©dito por las siguientes razones:


	Para estar seguro de que la informaci√≥n registrada es exacta, completa y actualizada antes de presentar una solicitud de pr√©stamo para hacer una compra importante, como por ejemplo una casa o un auto, para comprar un seguro o para solicitar un empleo.
	Para ayudarlo a protegerse contra el robo de identidad. Esto se produce cuando alguien utiliza su informaci√≥n personal ‚Äî como por ejemplo su nombre, n√∫mero de Seguro Social o n√∫mero de tarjeta de cr√©dito ‚Äî para cometer fraude. Los ladrones de identidad pueden utilizar su informaci√≥n para abrir una nueva cuenta de tarjeta de cr√©dito a su nombre. Luego, cuando no pagan las facturas, la cuenta en mora se reporta a su informe de cr√©dito. La informaci√≥n inexacta de este tipo podr√≠a afectar su capacidad de obtener cr√©dito, seguro y hasta de conseguir un empleo.


P. ¬øCu√°nto tiempo tardar√°n en entregarme mi informe a partir de la fecha de mi solicitud?

R.&nbsp;Si usted lo solicita en l√≠nea a trav√©s de annualcreditreport.com, deber√≠a poder acceder inmediatamente a su informe. Si lo solicita telef√≥nicamente llamando al n√∫mero gratuito 1-877-322-8228, su informe ser√° procesado y enviado por correo dentro de 15 d√≠as. Si usted lo solicita por correo mediante el env√≠o del formulario Annual Credit Report Request Form, su pedido ser√° procesado y enviado por correo dentro de los 15 d√≠as posteriores a su recepci√≥n.

En caso de que la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores necesitara mayor informaci√≥n para verificar su identidad, podr√≠a tomar algo m√°s de tiempo ya sea que usted solicite su informe en l√≠nea, telef√≥nicamente o por correo.

En algunas ocasiones, las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s reciben grandes cantidades de solicitudes de informes de cr√©dito. En estos casos, es posible que se le pida que presente su solicitud nuevamente. Tambi√©n es posible que le digan que su informe le ser√° enviado por correo un poco despu√©s del plazo de 15 d√≠as contados a partir de la fecha de su solicitud. En cualquiera de estos casos, usted ser√° informado por las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores.

P. ¬øExisten otras situaciones que determinan la elegibilidad para recibir un informe de cr√©dito gratuito?

R.&nbsp;Bajo lo dispuesto por ley federal, usted tiene derecho a recibir un informe gratuito si una compa√±√≠a toma una acci√≥n adversa en su contra, como por ejemplo la denegaci√≥n de su solicitud de cr√©dito, seguro o empleo y cuando usted solicita su informe dentro de un plazo de 60 d√≠as contado a partir de la fecha de recepci√≥n de la notificaci√≥n de la acci√≥n adversa. Mediante la notificaci√≥n se le proporcionar√° el nombre, domicilio y n√∫mero de tel√©fono de la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores. Usted tambi√©n tiene derecho a obtener un informe gratuito en caso de que se encuentre desempleado y tenga planes de buscar empleo dentro de los 60 d√≠as; si usted recibe asistencia p√∫blica; o si su informe es inexacto debido a un fraude, incluido el robo de identidad. De lo contrario, una compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores puede cobrarle hasta $10.50 por cada informe de cr√©dito adicional solicitado dentro de los 12 meses. Para comprar una copia de su informe, comun√≠quese con:


	Equifax:1-800-685-1111;&nbsp;equifax.com
	Experian: 1-888-397-3742;&nbsp;experian.com
	TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800;&nbsp;transunion.com


Bajo lo establecido por la ley estatal, los consumidores de Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey y Vermont ya tienen derecho a obtener informes de cr√©dito gratuitamente.

P. ¬øDeber√≠a solicitar un informe a cada una de las tres compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s?

R.&nbsp;Eso queda a su consideraci√≥n. Debido a que las compa√±√≠as nacionales de informes de los consumidores obtienen su informaci√≥n de diferentes fuentes, la informaci√≥n registrada por una compa√±√≠a puede no reflejar toda o la misma informaci√≥n que se registra en las otras dos compa√±√≠as. Esto no significa que la informaci√≥n registrada en alguno de sus informes es inexacta, s√≥lo que los informes pueden ser diferentes entre s√≠ dependiendo del tipo de informaci√≥n que registra cada agencia.

P. ¬øDeber√≠a solicitar mis informes a las tres compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores al mismo tiempo?

R.&nbsp;Seg√∫n usted lo desee, puede solicitar uno, dos o tres informes al mismo tiempo o bien puede escalonar sus solicitudes. Algunos asesores financieros se√±alan que una buena manera de controlar la exactitud y totalidad de la informaci√≥n registrada en sus informes de cr√©dito es escalonar sus solicitudes a lo largo de un per√≠odo de 12 meses.

P. ¬øQu√© debo hacer si encuentro errores ‚Äî ya sea inexactitudes o informaci√≥n incompleta ‚Äî en mi informe de cr√©dito?

R.&nbsp;Bajo las disposiciones de la ley FCRA, tanto las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores como el proveedor de la informaci√≥n (vale decir, la persona, compa√±√≠a u organizaci√≥n que le provee la informaci√≥n sobre usted a una compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores) son responsables de corregir la informaci√≥n inexacta o incompleta registrada en su archivo. Para beneficiarse de todos los derechos que le otorga esta ley, comun√≠quese con la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores y con el proveedor de informaci√≥n.


	Inf√≥rmele por escrito a la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores cu√°les son los datos registrados que usted piensa que son inexactos. Las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores deben investigar los datos cuestionados ‚Äî generalmente dentro de los 30 d√≠as ‚Äî a menos que consideren que su disputa carece de fundamentos.&nbsp;
	
	Las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores tambi√©n deben remitir todos los datos relevantes que usted les proporcione sobre la inexactitud de la informaci√≥n a la organizaci√≥n que la suministr√≥. Luego de que el proveedor de informaci√≥n reciba una notificaci√≥n de disputa de parte de la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores, √©sta tiene que investigar, revisar la informaci√≥n relevante y reportar los resultados de la investigaci√≥n a la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores. En caso de que el proveedor de la informaci√≥n descubriera que la informaci√≥n disputada es inexacta, debe notific√°rselo a las tres compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores del pa√≠s para que √©stas puedan corregir la informaci√≥n asentada en su registro. Una vez completada la investigaci√≥n, la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores debe entregarle a usted los resultados por escrito y una copia gratuita de su informe en caso de que surja un cambio como resultado de su disputa. (Este informe gratuito no es considerado su informe gratuito anual al que usted tiene derecho bajo las disposiciones de la ley FACT Act.) Si un dato es cambiado o eliminando, la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores no puede volver a colocar la informaci√≥n disputada en su registro a menos que el proveedor de la informaci√≥n verifique que la misma es exacta y completa. Asimismo, la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores debe enviarle una notificaci√≥n escrita en la cual se incluya el nombre, domicilio y n√∫mero de tel√©fono del proveedor de la informaci√≥n.
	&nbsp;
	Inf√≥rmele por escrito al acreedor u otro proveedor de informaci√≥n que se encuentra disputando un dato. Muchos proveedores de informaci√≥n especifican una direcci√≥n para las disputas. En caso de que el proveedor de la informaci√≥n reporte el dato a una compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores, debe incluir una notificaci√≥n de su disputa o cuestionamiento. Inf√≥rmele por escrito a la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores cu√°les son los datos registrados que usted piensa que son inexactos.
	
	Adem√°s, en caso de que usted est√© en lo cierto ‚Äî vale decir, que se descubra que la informaci√≥n es inexacta ‚Äî el proveedor de la informaci√≥n no puede reportarla nuevamente.


P. ¬øQu√© puedo hacer si la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores o el proveedor de informaci√≥n se niega a corregir la informaci√≥n disputada?

R.&nbsp;En el caso de que una investigaci√≥n no resuelva su disputa con la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores, usted puede pedir que se incluya una declaraci√≥n de su disputa o cuestionamiento en su registro y en los informes futuros. Tambi√©n puede solicitarle a la compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores que le remita su declaraci√≥n a todo aquel que hubiera recibido una copia de su informe recientemente. Es posible que tenga que pagar un cargo por este servicio. Si usted le comunica al proveedor de informaci√≥n que esta disputando un dato, √©ste debe incluir una notificaci√≥n de su disputa cada vez que le reporte el dato en cuesti√≥n a una compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores.

P. ¬øPor cu√°nto tiempo puede reportar informaci√≥n negativa una compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores?

R.&nbsp;Una compa√±√≠a de informes de los consumidores puede reportar la mayor√≠a de la informaci√≥n negativa durante siete a√±os, y los casos de quiebra o bancarrota pueden reportarse durante un per√≠odo de 10 a√±os. No existe un l√≠mite de tiempo para reportar informaci√≥n relacionada a sentencias penales, informaci√≥n reportada en respuesta a una solicitud suya de empleo para un trabajo con una remuneraci√≥n de m√°s de $75,000 por a√±o ni para la informaci√≥n reportada como resultado de una solicitud de cr√©dito o seguro de vida por un valor superior a $150,000. La informaci√≥n relacionada a una demanda legal o a un fallo judicial impago dispuesto en su contra puede ser reportada durante siete a√±os o hasta tanto haya expirado el estatuto de limitaciones, aplic√°ndose el plazo m√°s extenso.

P. ¬øQui√©n m√°s puede obtener una copia de mi informe de cr√©dito?

R.&nbsp;La ley FCRA especifica qui√©nes son las personas con derecho a acceder su informe de cr√©dito. Entre aquellos que poseen un derecho legal a acceder su informe de cr√©dito se encuentran los otorgantes de cr√©dito, aseguradores, empleadores y otros negocios que pueden utilizar la informaci√≥n registrada en su informe para evaluar sus solicitudes de cr√©dito, seguro, empleo o alquiler de viviendas.

P. ¬øMi empleador puede obtener mi informe de cr√©dito?

R.&nbsp;Su empleador puede obtener una copia de su informe de cr√©dito solamente si usted lo autoriza. Las compa√±√≠as de informes de los consumidores no pueden suministrar informaci√≥n sobre usted a su actual o potencial empleador sin poseer su consentimiento escrito. Su empleador puede obtener una copia de su informe de cr√©dito solamente si usted lo autoriza.

The new one-stop website works with the FTC‚Äôs consumer complaint system, allowing consumers who are victims of identity theft to quickly file a complaint with the FTC. Then they can get a custom guide to recovery that helps simplify many of the steps involved.


IdentityTheft.gov homepage


	The upgraded site is mobile and tablet friendly.
	It offers easy-to-use tools to help identity theft victims create the documents they need to alert police, the main credit bureaus, the IRS and others.


Kansas Legal Services also offers help in creating letters to send to major creditors and reporting agencies, please read below.

What is Identity Theft?

Identity Theft is the largest consumer complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) annually.&nbsp; If you have been the victim of identity theft, it could mean someone has used your name to:


	make purchases,
	get credit cards
	rent an apartment or
	obtain utilities without your permission.


In some cases, thieves may have received medical services in your name, re-routed your tax refund, or even posed as you during contact with law enforcement.

Identity theft may also include someone using checks on your account.&nbsp;This could be from stealing your checkbook or electronically obtaining access to your checking account.&nbsp;Use of an ATM card or credit card that you did not approve is also identity theft.&nbsp;

In some cases, identity theft occurs within families to children, seniors, and domestic violence survivors, making reporting and recovery particularly difficult.

How Might it Impact Me?

Even if you are able to resolve a financial identity theft issue with your bank, this use of your name and credit history can result in other problems. You could get collection letters for things you did not purchase.&nbsp;

It can also result in negative entries on your credit report, causing you problems in getting credit or paying a higher interest rate.

Becoming the victim of an identity theft can be a complex and frustrating time in your life.



What Can I Do?

The&nbsp;Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;has created letters (in&nbsp;this booklet) that consumers can use to let a debt collector or credit bureau know of the theft of your identity.

To use the letters, you must first report the crime of identity theft to the police.&nbsp; You do not need to know the name of the person who used your identity.&nbsp;You show the police the debt collection letters or other proof that you are the victim of this crime.&nbsp;

The three forms below use the FTC-created material.&nbsp;

You can also visit the&nbsp;National Identity Theft Victims Assistance Network&nbsp;to learn more.

The Federal Trade Commission offers&nbsp;forms and sample letters for victims of identity theft&nbsp;that help you get started.&nbsp;

309,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1584,Obama Cuts Student-Debt Collector Commissions to Aid Borrowers,,,Consumer,"By John Hechinger on March 19, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;From BloombergBusinessweek

President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration slashed the commissions paid to private collection companies that chase overdue student loans, reducing an incentive to squeeze borrowers.

Previously, the U.S. Education Department paid a commission as high as 16 percent of the entire loan amount only if collectors convinced defaulted borrowers to make stiff monthly payments. Starting this month, the fee dropped as low as 11 percent, no matter the payments‚Äô size, according to a copy of a new contract obtained under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.

With $77.4 billion worth of student loans in default, the federal government turns to an army of private collectors to pursue borrowers. These companies, which receive about $1 billion annually in commissions, have faced growing complaints that they insist on high payments, even when borrowers qualify for leniency, Bloomberg News reported in March 2012. Under the new schedule, collectors will no longer have an incentive to avoid offering affordable payments tied to borrowers‚Äô incomes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big deal,‚Äù said Persis Yu, a staff attorney with the Boston-based National Consumer Law Center. ‚ÄúIt will make life easier for borrowers. We‚Äôre not setting people up to fail.‚Äù

Making Good

Federal-aid law requires collectors to offer ‚Äúreasonable and affordable‚Äù payments, so debtors can rehabilitate their loans, repairing their credit and making good on what they owe taxpayers.

Under Education Department contracts, collection companies rehabilitate a defaulted loan by getting a borrower to make nine payments in 10 months.

The law mandates no minimum payment for a borrower to enter a rehabilitation program, and collection companies may take borrowers‚Äô finances into account.

Yet, under the old contract, the companies received a much higher commission if borrowers made a minimum payment of 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent of the loan each month, depending on its size.

For example, a $20,000 loan would require payments of about $200 a month for the collection company to get its full commission. Then, the collector would receive 16 percent of the loan amount -- or $3,200. If the payment fell below that figure, the collector got an administrative fee of $150.

That differential provided an incentive for collectors to insist on the amount triggering the commission and fail to tell borrowers they could pay less, Yu said. Under the new contract, borrowers with high debts and low incomes could get back on track while making payments of as little as $5 a month, while collectors could still make their commission.

Obama Effort

The new commission schedule is part of an Obama administration effort to give borrowers a break as student loan debt surpassed $1 trillion amid skyrocketing tuition costs. As of last year, 5.7 million student-loan borrowers were in default, generally meaning they have failed to make payments for 270 days or more.

In 2009, Congress expanded a program that lets students tie payments to their incomes. Obama has pushed to make the program more generous.

It‚Äôs a sliding scale, based on their debt, salaries and family obligations. A single borrower with $25,000 in loans and $20,000 in income would have to pay about $40 a month, according to a government loan calculator. If circumstances don‚Äôt improve, the loans can be canceled in as few as 20 years.

Flexible Repayment

The Education Department wants to provide ‚Äúflexible repayment options‚Äù while maintaining ‚Äúa reasonable balance between borrower and taxpayer interests,‚Äù spokesman Chris Greene said in an e-mail.

Twenty-two collection companies work directly for the Education Department. They include Horsham, Pennsylvania-based NCO, a unit of Expert Global Solutions Inc., which is majority- owned by&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM)‚Äôs private-equity arm, and Pioneer Credit Recovery, owned by&nbsp;SLM (SLM)&nbsp;Corp., commonly known as Sallie Mae, the largest student-loan company.

Most of the same outfits have contracts with state guarantee agencies that also chase student-loan borrowers on the government‚Äôs behalf. The contract change applies only to collectors working directly for the federal government.

Former debt collectors told Bloomberg News they worked in a ‚Äúboiler-room‚Äù environment, where they could earn bonuses of thousands of dollars a month, restaurant gift cards and even trips to foreign resorts if they collected enough from borrowers. In the year ended in September 2011, the department received 1,406 complaints against the debt collectors it hires, up 41 percent from the year before.

Taxpayer Money

Debt collection companies said they follow federal laws and use all available tools to recover money for taxpayers, helping to make sure future college students have access to financial aid. The companies helped the Education Department recover $13.1 billion in defaulted loans during the year ended Sept. 30.

Regardless of commission rates, NCO offers ‚Äúall available federal programs,‚Äù Tim Galloway, senior vice president, said in a phone interview. The company always treats borrowers ‚Äúwith dignity and respect,‚Äù he said.

Pioneer ‚Äúworks one-on-one‚Äù with defaulted student-loan borrowers, offering government programs ‚Äúhelping them return the money they borrowed to American taxpayers,‚Äù Patricia Nash Christel, a Sallie Mae spokesman, said in an e-mail.

319,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1681,What to do if . . . you get sued for money.,Consumer,sued,Consumer,"If you get a summons saying that you have been sued for a debt or another reason, you should do the following:

Learn what type of case you are involved in. &nbsp;

The simplest way is to look at whether the summons gives you a specific date to appear in Court.&nbsp;


	If it does give you a specific date, you are involved in a limited action case.
	If it does not give a specific date, it may give you 20 days from receipt of the paperwork to file the answer. Here, you are involved in a ""Chapter 60"" case.


Determine the date for appearing in court or filing your answer.


	Put that date on a calendar, so you don't forget.
	Failing to meet the deadline means that you lose the case, even if you have a good defense.


Learn more about the process for handling the type of case you are involved in.


	Click below to learn about Limited Action Cases and filing answers.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Limited Action


	More info will be added about Chapter 60 cases at a later time.


If you have a reason why you don‚Äôt owe this money, tell the Court


	You should write a reply to this&nbsp;lawsuit&nbsp;and file it with the Clerk of the District Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;
	This is called an ‚ÄúAnswer‚Äù.&nbsp;This is the first step in asking for a trial, at which you can present your defense to the Judge.
	If you file an answer before your appearance date, you do not need to appear in court on the date stated in a Chapter 61 summons.&nbsp;


Information below will guide you about how to prepare and file the answer with the Clerk of the District Court.

‚ñ∫&nbsp;If you agreed in your reply to the charges made by the&nbsp;plaintiff, then a binding legal court judgment will be entered. This will be entered against you by the Judge in the amount asked for by the&nbsp;Plaintiff. &nbsp;You can meet with the attorney for the&nbsp;plaintiff, and try to work out a sensible payment plan with them. Make sure if you do that it‚Äôs in writing, or confirmed in writing. Then, make sure you keep the agreement.&nbsp;

Try not to pay in cash, but if you have to, be sure you get a receipt. Make sure that the payments are traceable, so you know they were received.&nbsp;

If you don‚Äôt reach an agreement OR if you make a plan and don‚Äôt keep it, the&nbsp;Plaintiff can:

1) garnish your paycheck and get 25% of your pay (if over minimum wage, 30 hours per week) OR

2) attach your bank account and take all the money in the account (unless you only have Social Security or SSI in the account).

‚ñ∫&nbsp;If you disagreed in the written answer&nbsp;filed with the Clerk of the District Court , you will receive a new order to appear. It will state a specific date for a pre-trial hearing. Don‚Äôt lose that date. &nbsp;

At the pre-trial hearing, the Judge will try to decide what the issues of dispute are in your case and see if the case can be settled. The judge will do so without hearing the&nbsp;testimony&nbsp;of witnesses or reviewing evidence.&nbsp; If an agreement can be reached, then the agreement becomes an order of the Judge.&nbsp;

If there is no agreement, then the case is set for a trial.&nbsp;

At the trial, the Petitioner must put on evidence to prove their case and the&nbsp;Defendant&nbsp;may put on evidence to counter the proof provided by the Petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

‚ñ∫&nbsp;Note:&nbsp;Some exchange of evidence may happen before trial.&nbsp; This could include&nbsp;interrogatories&nbsp;or requests for admission, which have specific deadlines that must be met or you can lose the right to have a trial.

Identity Theft:&nbsp;


	If you want to file an answer stating you don't owe a debt due to identity theft, Kansas Legal Services has an interactive interview to prepare that document for you.&nbsp;Click here.
	You can use the identity theft answer if the debt is the result of a credit card that you did not apply for, receive or use, or a card that was used after you notified the&nbsp;creditor&nbsp;that it was stolen and/or used by an unauthorized person,


Statute of Limitations:&nbsp;


	You can raise a statute of limitation defense in your answer in certain types of cases.
	This is when it is a written agreement to borrow money and more than 5 years have passed since you last paid on the debt or since you last admitted that you owed the money. This includes owning up to the debt over the phone.
	There is an interactive interview to prepare that reply for you.&nbsp;Click here.


Other:&nbsp;


	If you have a different reason for believing you don't owe the debt, you can file an answer stating your reasons.
	You can complete the form&nbsp;here. There are step-by-step instructions for preparing and filing this form.


General Tips:


	As with any case, dates are important so write them down and make sure to follow deadlines.&nbsp;
	Also, make 2 copies of everything and keep a copy for yourself. &nbsp;
	Remember, court clerks and judges cannot give you legal advice.

barriers to employment",Consumer,"Some employers and landlords check into your background before deciding whether to hire you or keep you on the job, or rent to you.

When they do a background check, you have legal rights under federal law. This page talks mostly about legal rights when applying for jobs.

It‚Äôs important to know whom to contact if you think someone has broken the law related to background checks.

Click here to learn about your housing rights under the Fair Housing Act.

Questions About Your Background

An employer might ask you questions about your background during the hiring process. For example, some employers might ask about your job history, your education, your criminal record, your financial history, your health history, or your use of online social media.

It‚Äôs legal for employers to ask questions about your background or to require a background check ‚Äî with certain exceptions. They‚Äôre not allowed to ask you for


	health information until they offer you a job, and
	they‚Äôre not allowed to ask for your family health history.


When an employer asks about your background, they must treat you the same as anyone else, no matter what your race is, or national origin, color, sex, religion, disability, &nbsp;health history, or age if you‚Äôre 40 or older. An employer isn‚Äôt allowed to ask for extra background information because you are, say, of a certain race or ethnicity.

If an employer treats you differently because of your race, national origin, color, sex, religion, disability, health history, or older age, or asks you questions about your health status and history, or family health history,&nbsp;click here to contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

How to get an expungement of your criminal record

KLS offers a&nbsp;free legal form&nbsp;to expunge records:


	
	Expungement of Criminal Records
	


Use of Background Reports

Some employers try to find out about your background by hiring someone to do a ‚Äúbackground report‚Äù on you. Among the most common are criminal background reports and credit reports. But special rules apply when an employer gets a background report about you from a company that is in the business of compiling background information.

Before getting the report, the employer must tell you that they might use the information to make a decision related to your employment, and must ask for your written permission. You don‚Äôt have to give your permission, but if you‚Äôre applying for a job and you don‚Äôt give your permission, the employer may reject your application. If an employer gets a background report on you without your permission,&nbsp;contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

If the employer thinks they might not hire, keep, or promote you because of something in the report, they must give you a copy of the report and a ‚ÄúSummary of Rights‚Äù that tells you how to contact the company that provided the report. That‚Äôs because background reports sometimes have mistakes. If you see a mistake in your background report,&nbsp;ask the background reporting company to fix it, and to send a copy of the corrected report to the employer. Tell the employer about the mistake, too.

Before you apply for a job, it‚Äôs a good idea to order a free copy of your credit report. That way, you can fix any mistakes before an employer sees it. To get your free credit report, visit&nbsp;www.annualcreditreport.com&nbsp;or call 1-877-322-8228. You don‚Äôt have to buy any products they offer, and you don‚Äôt have to pay to get mistakes corrected.

If the Employer Finds Something Negative in Your Background

If your background report has some negative information, be prepared to explain it ‚Äî and the reason it shouldn‚Äôt affect your ability to do the job. Here is a description of your rights, depending on what type of negative information the employer finds:

Criminal History or Other Public Records

If you don‚Äôt get hired or promoted because of information in your criminal history or other public records, the employer must tell you orally, in writing, or electronically:


	the name, address, and phone number of the company that supplied the criminal history or public records report;
	that the company that provided the information didn‚Äôt make the decision to take the adverse action and can‚Äôt give you specific reasons for it; and
	that you have the right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of any information in the report, and to an additional free report from the company that supplied it, if you ask for it within 60 days of the employer‚Äôs decision not to hire or retain you.


The company that provided the employer with negative information from a criminal history or other public records has certain obligations: it has to tell you that it provided the information and it has to take certain steps to make sure the information is accurate.

Some employers might say not to apply if you have a criminal record. That could be discrimination. If that happens to you, contact the EEOC. Find more information on:


	arrest and conviction records in employment decisions
	arrest and conviction records as an automatic bar to all employment


Credit Report/Financial Information

If an employer decides not to hire, keep, or promote you based on financial information in a background report, it must tell you ‚Äî orally, in writing, or electronically. Specifically, the employer must:


	give you the name, address, and phone number of the company that supplied the credit report or background information;
	give you a statement that the company that supplied the information didn‚Äôt make the decision to take the adverse action and can‚Äôt give you any specific reasons for it; and
	give you a notice of your right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of any information in your report and to get an additional free report from the company that supplied the credit or other background information if you ask for it within 60 days.


Race, National Origin, Color, Sex, Religion, Disability, Genetic Information, Age

Sometimes, it‚Äôs legal for an employer not to hire you or keep you on because of information in your background, and sometimes, it isn‚Äôt. For example, it‚Äôs illegal when the employer has different background requirements depending on your race, national origin, color, sex, religion, disability, genetic information (including family medical history), or age, if you‚Äôre 40 or older. It‚Äôs also illegal for an employer to reject applicants of one ethnicity with criminal records for a job, but not to reject other applicants with the same criminal records.

Even if the employer treats you the same as everyone else, using background information still can be illegal discrimination. For example, employers shouldn‚Äôt use a policy or practice that excludes people with certain criminal records if it significantly disadvantages individuals of a particular race, national origin, or another protected characteristic, and doesn‚Äôt accurately predict who will be a responsible, reliable, or safe employee. In legal terms, the policy or practice has a ‚Äúdisparate impact‚Äù and is not ‚Äújob related and consistent with business necessity.‚Äù

If you think an employer discriminated against you based on information in your background report,&nbsp;contact the EEOC.

Medical Condition

If the employer makes a decision based on information about a medical condition, you can ask for a chance to show that you still can do the job. Find specific information on:


	pre-employment medical inquiries
	medical inquiries during employment
	genetic inquiries, including inquiries about family medical history


Where to Go For Help

The FTC enforces the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), a federal law that regulates background reports for employment. The EEOC enforces federal laws against employment discrimination.

FTC

If an employer got your background report without asking your permission, or rejected you without sending you the required notices, contact the FTC at ftc.gov, 1- 877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) or 1-866-653-4261 (TTY).

Why report it to the FTC? Because the FCRA allows the FTC, other federal agencies, and states to sue employers who don‚Äôt comply with the law‚Äôs provisions. The FCRA also allows people to sue employers in state or federal court for certain violations.

EEOC

If you think that a background check was discriminatory, you may contact the EEOC by visiting its website at www.eeoc.gov, or calling 1-800-669-4000 or 1-800-669-6820 (TTY).

The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person‚Äôs race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The EEOC investigates, conciliates, and mediates charges of employment discrimination, and also files lawsuits in the public interest.

381,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1949,FAQs on protecting yourself from identity theft,,,Consumer,"What can I do to protect myself if my credit cards are stolen?

Do not sign the back of your credit cards. Instead, put 'PHOTO ID REQUIRED.'&nbsp; You will have to show the photo id every time you want to use your card.&nbsp; Be courteous when asked by a store clerk or offer the photo id when you use your credit card.&nbsp;

How can I protect my identity when I make payments on my credit card accounts?

When you are writing checks to pay on your credit card or other accounts, DO NOT put the &nbsp;complete account number on the 'For' or ‚ÄòMemo‚Äô line. Instead, just put the last four numbers. The credit card company knows the rest of the number, and anyone who might be handling your check as it passes through all the check processing channels won't have access to it.

What else can I do to protect my identity when I write checks?

Put your work phone number on your checks instead of your home phone. If you have a PO Box, use that instead of your home address. If you do not have a PO Box, use your work address. Never have your Social Security number printed on your checks. If you have it printed, anyone can get it.

How can I protect my identity if my wallet is stolen?

Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine. Do both sides of each license, credit card, etc. You will know what you had in your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and cancel.

Keep the photocopy in a safe place.&nbsp; Consider putting it someplace you can access electronically from anywhere.&nbsp; But, be certain that the electronic information is password protected.

How can I protect my identity when I travel?

Carry a photocopy of your passport when you travel either here or abroad. If your passport is stolen, the copy makes it easier to get replaced.

How can I protect my identity immediately when my ID and/or credit cards are stolen or lost?

We have been told we should cancel our credit cards immediately. But the key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them.

File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where your credit cards, etc., were stolen. This proves to credit providers you were diligent, and this is a first step toward an investigation.

Call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and also call the Social Security fraud line number.

The alert means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen, and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit.

Use caution if they ask you about a credit ‚Äúfreeze.‚Äù&nbsp; This will deny you access to credit as well, until the ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù time passes.

Here are the numbers you always need to contact if your wallet has been stolen:

1.) Equifax: 1-800-525-62851-800-525-6285

2.) Experian (formerly TRW):&nbsp;1-888-397-3742&nbsp;1-888-397-3742

3.) Trans Union : 1-800-680 7289 1-800-680 7289

4.) Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271&nbsp;1-800-269-0271

Other tips:

Open your mail promptly.&nbsp; Review your bank statements and credit card statements.&nbsp; If you see a mistake, you can call about it.&nbsp; If that doesn‚Äôt immediately resolve things, you must put your concerns in writing, following the instructions on the back of the billing statement.&nbsp;

A phone call does not establish your legal rights under the Federal laws that protect you and your credit history.&nbsp; Your concern must be in WRITING.

On September&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)&nbsp;announced enforcement actions&nbsp;against Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the two largest debt buyers active in the United States.

According to the Bureau, Encore will pay up to $42 million in refunds to affected consumers, a $10 million fine and cease collection on $125 million in debts. Portfolio will pay $19 million in consumer refunds, a $8 million fine and cease collection on over $3 million in debts.

The CFPB documented the companies buying debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacking documentation or unenforceable, filing lawsuits without verifying debts and using false statements to pressure consumers into making payments.

Lisa Stifler, Policy Counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, gave the following statement:


The Portfolio Recovery Associates and Encore Capital Group consent orders underscore the questionable tactics used by even the largest debt buyers attempting to collect old debts ‚Äì deception, intimidation, and the mass-production of lawsuits against the wrong people for the wrong amount of money.

Today‚Äôs action by the CFPB confirms that debt buyers cannot abuse consumers, and that they must act responsibly when trying to collect.

It is absolutely urgent that the CFPB propose new rules that will stop all debt collectors from engaging in abusive behavior, prevent them from collecting debts based on inaccurate information, and punish them when they do lie to courts and consumers.

States must also act to safeguard residents from frivolous lawsuits and ensure the integrity of their courts. Consumers deserve to be protected from wrongful collection and legal action, and today's announcement is a step in the right direction.

Suspended

Wichita",Consumer,"By&nbsp;Carla Eckels &nbsp;&nbsp;Nov. 23, 2015 &nbsp;KMUW Wichita

Nearly 8,000 motorists in Wichita have had their driver‚Äôs licenses suspended this year. Many of them find it difficult to pay the fines to be reinstated.

Residents will get a second chance to resolve traffic obligations in December through a new amnesty program offered by the city.

The amnesty program will assist residents who have not resolved their traffic citation, such as for speeding or for failure to yield. Donte Martin, municipal court administrator for the City of Wichita is hoping people will take advantage of the program.

Donte Martin, municipal court administrator, City of Wichita

""A person who had a traffic citation who didn‚Äôt comply with the citation, namely they didn‚Äôt set the matter for court, they didn‚Äôt appear in court or they didn‚Äôt pay the citation, [and] that citation remains outstanding. That obligation remains owed,"" Martin says. ""So during the amnesty program, we‚Äôre going to encourage people to come in and voluntarily resolve their obligations.""

Fines and fees can add up quickly. For example, if a driver is ticketed for speeding 10 mph over the limit, he may be required to pay about $120 in fines and costs. The total amount owed prior to amnesty could end up being about $350 due to fines, court costs, warrant fees, city and state reinstatement fees, and collections fees. If drivers have multiple ticket infractions, it can add up.

""We will recall warrants. We will wave city reinstatement fees. We will also wave collection fees if they‚Äôve been assessed, and basically give people a chance to get their licenses reinstated,"" Martin says.

The program was created after Martin and Wichita City Manager Robert Layton heard comments at a standing-room-only meeting hosted by Sunflower Community Action.

""We heard firsthand from area residents the impact that suspended driver‚Äôs licenses were having on their ability to obtain employment and having a negative impact to their quality of life,"" Martin says.



&nbsp;

Sunflower Community Action organizer&nbsp;Djuan Wash says the grassroots organization has heard hundreds of complaints about residents having their licenses suspended.

""It‚Äôs really an economic issue because it prevents people from being able to get back and forth to work, back and forth to church, back and forth to the doctor, so all of these things are incredibly important,"" Wash says.&nbsp;

And he says many of the complaints are similar.

""It's a downward spirial,"" he says. ""People end up getting a ticket, they can't afford to pay that ticket back, so they don't end up paying it. The license gets suspended, and it's just a downward cycle from there.""

Wash says people often end up with multiple tickets and don‚Äôt have the ability to pay.

""Some of them have thousands of dollars in fines and fees, so the city recognized that this was a problem and decided to go ahead and partner with us to provide a solution,"" he says.

Martin says participants in the amnesty program will still be responsible for paying any outstanding court costs and traffic fines, but not necessarily all up front.

""If a person is unable to pay in full they will be able to sign up for a payment plan that will allow them to pay the amount owed over the course of 12 months,"" Martin says.

In addition, Martin says there‚Äôs help for the unemployed.

""Those that are unable to pay due to financial hardship or lack of employment will have the opportunity to perform community services at local agencies or attend training at workforce alliances aimed at developing job skills and gaining employment,"" he says. ""Those performing community or work force alliance programming will receive credit toward their outstanding fines.""



Djuan Wash with Sunflower Community Action.&nbsp;

Still, Wash acknowledges some residents are a bit skeptical of taking advantage of the amnesty program--thinking it‚Äôs some kind of set-up.

""They think they are going to come in and get arrested, and this program is not going to be a set up,"" he says. ""They are waiving warrants.""

The program ""isn't a trick,"" Martin stresses.

""The program is an effort to truly help residents resolve outstanding court obligations,"" he says. ""If a person has an outstanding warrant on a non-traffic matter, they will have an opportunity to see a judge and potentially have their court dates reset.""

Martin says the amnesty program will also include the ability to&nbsp;obtain a restricted license.

It‚Äôs the first time that the City of Wichita and the State of Kansas have partnered in offering a program that encourages residents to voluntarily resolve their obligations and obtain a restricted license.

""The benefit of the state‚Äôs restricted license program is that it allows you to drive today, and it gives you 12 months to resolve outstanding court obligations,"" he says. ""You don‚Äôt have to wait for your license to be reinstated to resume driving.""

Once you are approved for the restricted license, Martin says you‚Äôre able drive to work, medical appointments and other court-ordered appointments.

Wash says he believes the amnesty program is a good solution, especially for those who are out of work and need a break to cover fees.

""As we canvass and we talk to people, this is an issue that touches everybody. It transcends race. We‚Äôve had white people, we‚Äôve had black people, we‚Äôve had Hispanic people,"" he says. ""It really touches everybody.""

And the city benefits from the program as well, Martin says.

""The city benefits by responding to the citizens' needs, assisting residents and obtaining driver‚Äôs licenses, and improving their quality of life,"" he says. ""It helps the court close open cases.""

The amnesty program kicks off Dec. 4 and runs through Dec. 30.

Drivers can check the status of their license through the Kansas Department of Revenue&nbsp;here.

For a couple years now, the State of Kansas has offered the way to get a restricted drivers license in some cases when the licenses has been suspended. &nbsp;

Any Kansans with a revoked drivers license should check this out.&nbsp;

Kansas Legal Services offers an interactive interview to assist Kansans with suspended driver's licenses who want to write a letter to request a restricted driver's license. Read more about that here.

&nbsp;

The number of Payday lenders has grown at an oddly rapid rate over the past few decades, mainly in low income areas. Typically these lenders market directly to low income borrowers, notably those on a steady, fixed, and certain income. Borrowers are often at or below the poverty level; many live off only fixed incomes and are elderly or disabled.

&nbsp;

The lenders boast that the borrower can get cash ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù and without a credit check. Advertising focuses on the borrower‚Äôs need for a quick fix in crisis conditions. The reality is that most borrowers who take out these loans trap themselves by mistake in an endless cycle of renewing the loan. The quick fix turns into a very stressful fiscal trap that often calls for the help of an advocate.

&nbsp;

The borrower‚Äôs definite income is central to how the payday lender works. A payday loan is normally short-term and high-cost and has one single payment due on the borrower‚Äôs payday. Loans are commonly for $500 or less and the interest can range anywhere between 125% to over 700%. When a borrower takes out the loan they only have to produce a statement showing the amount of their assured income and proof of the day it is deposited. After a borrower is approved, a post-dated check is given by the borrower to the lender. Typically for a $500 loan, the borrower will write a check for $575. The borrower then agrees that the lender will cash the check on the due date unless the borrower comes back in person to discuss the loan. The Payday lender in fact banks on the borrower not being able to pay the loan back.

&nbsp;

When the borrower appears at the Payday lender to explain they cannot pay the loan back, the lender commonly agrees to collect the interest and instantly renew the loan. A typical loan of $500 (for 30 days) usually has an interest fee of $75 (a 182.5% interest rate). When the borrower comes in to explain that they cannot afford to pay the $575 that day, the lender will accept the $75 interest payment. The lender then agrees to renew the loan until the next month. With renewal, the borrower will still owe $575 the next month-- having gotten nowhere but further behind in terms of money.

&nbsp;

Most borrowers wanted the loan in the first place because they were short on cash when their fixed or low incomes could not meet their expenses. Loans are often taken out to pay common living expenses like rent, food, utility bills, car repairs, etc. &nbsp;When the next month comes and the borrower doesn‚Äôt have the money again the cycle continues. Basically the borrower is paying the lender $75, over and over and over, to not collect on the loan.

&nbsp;

The lender is in a strong position. The borrower knows that, if the loan is not paid, the lender will cash the post-dated check, often making the borrower‚Äôs deposit account negative. Thus, bills and essential needs like rent, food, and bills will not be covered. If the check bounces then the borrower will incur added fees with their bank as well as with and the Payday lender. Even though Social Security and/or disability payments are protected by Federal law, they lose their protection if the recipient freely grants the creditor access to the funds. As a result, it can quickly become a desperate position for the borrower.

&nbsp;

These cases often end terribly. The borrower ends up defaulting and not only owing the Payday lender extra fees, but also owing their own banks because of a negative account balance. Along with overdraft penalties, many banks also charge daily fees on overdrawn accounts. Payday lenders employ aggressive collection agencies to try and collect the loans and can garnish wages or take borrowers to court. Some borrowers take out other Payday loans to prevent the catastrophe that will sooner or later happen when the first Payday loan defaults. These loans should be avoided. If you or someone you know is caught up in this trap and need help please contact Kansas Legal Services, 800-723-6953 for free legal help from a licensed attorney.&nbsp;

Read about Kansas&nbsp;expungement laws and how to expunge your record.


Continue reading the main story

&nbsp;

In the United States, only those who are convicted of the most serious crimes get life sentences. But everyone who enters the criminal justice system can be marked for life. Even the briefest minor interaction with the justice system can leave someone with a criminal record ‚Äî and a permanent barrier to a job, housing, education or an occupational license.

A publicly available criminal record can include much more than felony convictions. It might also include:

‚Ä¢ Your arrest for swinging a punch in a bar fight at age 20. But the record might not say that you were released without charges.

‚Ä¢ The warrant issued when you were late paying traffic tickets, even if it was dismissed upon payment.

‚Ä¢ Your misdemeanor conviction for possessing a small bag of marijuana.

‚Ä¢ Your guilty plea to a minor charge ‚Äî even though you didn‚Äôt commit a crime ‚Äî just to get out of jail and put the process behind you.

‚Ä¢ A not-guilty verdict from a trial.

According to the&nbsp;National Employment Law Project, half the arrest records in the F.B.I.‚Äôs database carry no information about the case‚Äôs disposition. Your record might list an arrest for a serious crime ‚Äî but omit the information that the case was dropped.


How do you keep a criminal record from poisoning your future? One way is to keep the information private.&nbsp;


At least 70 million Americans&nbsp;have a criminal record&nbsp;‚Äî that‚Äôs the&nbsp;same number of Americans&nbsp;who have college degrees. Roughly 20 million of those have a felony conviction. The rest were either convicted of misdemeanors (often without a lawyer present) or never convicted of anything; they were never charged, had charges dropped or were found not guilty. But they still have a record.

America‚Äôs growing, bipartisan movement for a fairer, more evidence-based and less punitive criminal justice system ‚Äî a movement with supporters ranging from Bernie Sanders to Charles Koch ‚Äî is bringing new attention to the aftereffects of arrest and incarceration.

States are passing laws allowing people with felony convictions to vote. And there is the ‚ÄúBan the Box‚Äù campaign, which seeks to remove the ‚Äúcheck here if you have a felony conviction‚Äù box (or sometimes ‚Äúcheck if you‚Äôve ever been arrested‚Äù or ‚Äúif you have a criminal record‚Äù) from initial job applications. The question would move to the job interview or later, so the job seeker can be judged on other merits first.

Like everything related to criminal justice, this is a race issue. If a white man and a black man commit the same crime, the black man is far more likely to be arrested and convicted. African-Americans make up&nbsp;12 percent of drug users, for example ‚Äî but 32 percent of people arrested for drug possession. A criminal record allows these biases to last forever.

The bias is greatest in arrests that do not lead to conviction or even charges. In many cities, arrests are used in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods as a means of intimidation and social control. ‚ÄúMove along,‚Äù the police say, and those who don‚Äôt are brought in for loitering or disorderly conduct.

In Baltimore in 2005, under Mayor Martin O‚ÄôMalley, the Zero Tolerance campaign included 108,000 arrests ‚Äî in a city of only 640,000. Tens of thousands of young minority men were arrested for simply hanging around or littering. The vast majority were either never charged with a crime, or released once they saw a judge.


There‚Äôs a word for people who aren‚Äôt convicted of a crime: innocent.


So why should an arrest record hurt? One reason is ignorance. In Maryland, when prosecutors drop a case, it‚Äôs listed as ‚Äúnolle prosequi.‚Äù Do you know what that means? Many employers don‚Äôt.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt understand that a particular charge did not result in conviction,‚Äù said Michael Pinard, professor and a director of the Clinical Law Program at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. ‚ÄúOr they know, but find that this particular charge is offensive ‚Äî they might look more at the charge than at the result. Others think that if a person has interacted with the criminal justice system, he must have done something wrong.‚Äù

Then add race to the mix. ‚ÄúA record might confirm a stereotype about an applicant based on race and socioeconomic status,‚Äù said Pinard. ‚ÄúGiven all we know about bias, stereotype, notions of criminality, it‚Äôs really important for many employers and landlords to look beyond a criminal record when dealing with a person of color.‚Äù

Employment is the single most important factor in the rehabilitation of someone with a prison record. Yet it is far harder to get a job with a prison record ‚Äî in one&nbsp;influential study&nbsp;published in 2009, having served time for possessing drugs with intent to distribute reduced callbacks for entry-level jobs by 50 percent for white applicants and by 64 percent for blacks.

Other researchers tested the most benign criminal history: a single arrest (no conviction) for disorderly conduct. That, too,&nbsp;depressed job offers, although to a much lesser extent.


It‚Äôs not just jobs. Having a record affects a credit rating.


Federal housing law grants local authorities wide discretion, and many use it to keep people with a single arrest ‚Äî no convictions ‚Äî out of public housing or the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. (Update: Last month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that such blanket bans were illegal, and that private landlords who use them violate the Fair Housing Act and can be sued or face penalties.) It affects education, too; two-thirds of colleges ask about criminal history in applications.

Many professional licenses are closed to people with a criminal record ‚Äî including those for cosmetologist, plumber and funeral director. In Oklahoma, anyone with&nbsp;two convictions&nbsp;for possessing any amount of marijuana&nbsp;can be barred from working&nbsp;as an interior designer, physical therapist or land surveyor.

Maryland is one of a small number of states that puts all criminal records into a database ‚Äî here called&nbsp;Case Search&nbsp;‚Äî that anyone can access free of charge. ‚ÄúWhen I started at the Public Defender, there was no Case Search, said Mary-Denise Davis, a public defender in Baltimore. ‚ÄúThe employer had to go and get an actual rap sheet, or had to go to the courthouse and manually search for cases. Now with Case Search, you click on a button and it‚Äôs available.‚Äù

And increasingly, employers do use it. When something like Case Search doesn‚Äôt exist, employers buy background checks from companies that sell them. According to a&nbsp;2012 survey&nbsp;by the Society for Human Resource Management, 87 percent of managers said they perform background checks on at least some hires (up from 51 percent in 1996), and 69 percent used them for all hires.

Expunging these records is far from a perfect solution. It‚Äôs impractical ‚Äî some cases make it to the Internet, where they cannot be erased. And official expungement doesn‚Äôt necessarily expunge the records held by companies that do background checks.

It‚Äôs also uncomfortable. Should I be able to sue someone who discloses my expunged record? Alabama just&nbsp;arrested a blogger&nbsp;for publishing expunged information. If your record is completely expunged, you may legally answer ‚Äúno‚Äù to the question of whether you‚Äôve ever been arrested or convicted. So you can legally lie.

‚ÄúIt is a very dangerous precedent to start destroying records,‚Äù said James B. Jacobs, professor of constitutional law and the courts and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law. He is the author of the book ‚ÄúThe Eternal Criminal Record.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a step against open government,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur records have always been available for scrutiny, to tell whether there is discrimination, corruption or unfairness.‚Äù Indeed, Case Search was a transparency move by the Maryland courts some 20 years ago. It‚Äôs helpful to lawyers and defendants, who can easily track cases. And if records contain mistakes, which they often do ‚Äî a huge problem with companies that assemble court data to do background checks ‚Äî people can catch them only if they can see them.


There‚Äôs an awakening that we continue to punish people over and over.


Despite expungement‚Äôs problems, Jacobs‚Äôs view that it is the greater evil is clearly a minority opinion. ‚ÄúThe movement to expunge or shield criminal records has been growing over the last couple of years,‚Äù said Inimai M. Chettiar, the director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an awakening that we continue to punish people over and over. This has a lot more appeal to politicians than letting people out of prison ‚Äî it‚Äôs getting people back into the community and on the job.‚Äù

Chettiar said that almost all states offer the opportunity for people with nonconvictions or some misdemeanor convictions to expunge or shield them after a waiting period.

But the rules are restrictive enough that few people take advantage. For example, before last year, the only convictions Maryland residents could expunge were those for nine misdemeanors related to homelessness, such as panhandling and public urination. The state also had a law called the subsequent conviction rule: no nonconviction could be expunged if the individual had a later conviction, even for a completely unrelated change.

Caryn York, senior policy advocate for the Baltimore-based nonprofit Job Opportunity Task Force, said that the group had been pushing Maryland legislators to expand expungements for more than a decade, with little result until last year. It was the uprising in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of the police that finally caught legislators‚Äô attention, she said.

The 2015 Maryland Second Chance Act, which went into effect in October, allowed shielding for 12 types of nonviolent misdemeanors, including prostitution and low levels of drug possession.

Another law repealed the subsequent conviction rule. ‚ÄúRepeal of that alone saw thousands of Marylanders able to have their records expunged,‚Äù said York.

And last week, Gov. Larry Hogan signed the massive Justice Reinvestment Act, a sweeping criminal justice reform bill, which, among many other things, provides drug treatment instead of jail for addicts. It expands expungement to misdemeanor theft and assault convictions.

The move toward expungement and shielding has broad support in Maryland. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen anyone oppose it,‚Äù John P. Morrissey, chief judge of the district court of Maryland, said in an interview. ‚ÄúOur challenge is dealing with the uptick in how many we have to process.‚Äù

There is more Maryland could do, especially to remove the noxious effects of nonconvictions. The state could, for example, simply stop putting them on Case Search. It could make expunging a nonconviction automatic ‚Äî the courts take care of it, with no action necessary from the defendant. (New Jersey, among other states, now does this.) Branching out, the state could review occupational licensing: a ban on people holding felony convictions might make sense for child care workers, but not for barbers.

The state already has a ‚Äúban the box‚Äù rule for government agencies, but the rest of the state could follow Baltimore in&nbsp;applying it to large and medium-size private employers. Twenty-three states have&nbsp;banned the box&nbsp;in hiring by government agencies ‚Äî almost all of them in the last six years. Eight states apply the prohibition to private employers as well. Many cities, do, too ‚Äî Baltimore requires employers to wait until a conditional job offer is extended before asking people about criminal histories or requesting criminal records. Earlier this month, President Obama&nbsp;proposed a rulerequiring federal agencies do the same.

‚ÄúPeople are led to believe if they resolve a case in a certain way, their troubles are behind them,‚Äù said Pinard, the law professor. ‚ÄúSo they plead guilty right away on some low-level charge. Later the true weight, the enormity of that interaction will suddenly come into their life. They don‚Äôt know what they have just gotten themselves into.‚Äù


Fortunately, Kansas has fairly liberal expungement laws, making it easier and quicker to get records expunged. Read about Kansas.


One major obstacle to expungement is that it‚Äôs been hard to do without lawyers ‚Äî and lawyers are expensive and in short supply. Technology solutions are often overhyped, but this is one area where they actually work.

By&nbsp;Emma Fiander&nbsp; Topeka Capital Journal&nbsp; &nbsp;emma.fiander@cjonline.com

Topekans with outstanding fines and arrest warrants issued for missed court dates will have an opportunity to right their record with the Topeka Municipal Court‚Äôs Clean Slate Day on Oct. 14.

On that day, individuals with an arrest warrant from the municipal court will be able to have it pulled in exchange for a new court date, said Administrative Judge Jason Geier. The day will also focus on expediting the expungement process ‚Äî allowing convictions to be cleared from a person‚Äôs record if they meet certain requirements. Currently, more than 10,000 people owe outstanding fines to the court, and 3,000 of them have resulted in arrest warrants.

Topeka‚Äôs Clean Slate Day follows on the heels of a similar day in Wichita this past March, as well as similar programs across the U.S.

Topeka‚Äôs will be unique, however, in the presence of free legal counsel, potential employers and other services to help participants.

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs not just come, take care of your warrants, get an expungement,‚Äù said Geier. ‚ÄúOther services are going to be there and be provided for folks to talk to, for people to truly have a clean slate day.‚Äù

Geier recognized a need for such a program when he made the switch from being a prosecutor in district court to a judge in municipal court and realized how little people know about the system.

Often, he said, people are either afraid that if they show up they will be jailed for not being able to pay the full amount of a fine, or the ticket is so small that they don‚Äôt take it seriously and fail to show up, which can result in an arrest warrant over a $10 ticket for failing to wear a seat belt.

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs kind of both of these perceptions as I sit up there and talk to people,‚Äù Geier said. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòWow, folks really need educated.‚Äô‚Äà‚Äù

Geier and the court have partnered with the city‚Äôs Department of Neighborhood Relations to engage in a community outreach project educating the public on why it is important to go to court. Geier will hold four ‚ÄúMeet the Judge‚Äù sessions throughout the month of September at Hillcrest Community Center, Central Park Community Center, Garfield Community Center and Oakland Community Center.

In addition to education, he also hopes to correct misconceptions about the city of Topeka and the Topeka Municipal Court that he feels have gained popularity in recent years.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, there have been some municipal courts across the United States that were perceived, rightly or wrongly, just to be a court to churn fees to finance the city. I was noticing that folks in Topeka have those same perceptions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBecause I was born and raised in Topeka, I wanted to make sure to let people know that, no, we don‚Äôt do that here. We don‚Äôt churn fees here. People get a fair shake here.‚Äù

Geier already has held five sessions: four through the Topeka Housing Authority and one with a neighborhood improvement association. At the sessions, Geier has encouraged citizens to not wait for Clean Slate Day but to come in as soon as possible to look into setting a new court date. He said he has already seen a response from the community.

‚ÄúSince we‚Äôve been doing this, we‚Äôve definitely started seeing an uptick in people coming in and taking care of their court business,‚Äù he said.

Though Clean Slate Day will offer services not typically available, Geier said that people can come in at any time, before or after Oct. 14, and arrange to have their warrant pulled or apply for expungement. The sooner a person comes in, the sooner they can move on. However, only 75 slots will be available the day of the event.

‚ÄúI would say the key is, don‚Äôt wait. This is definitely an opportunity for people to empower themselves,‚Äù said Monique Glaude, of the Department of Neighborhood Relations. ‚ÄúThis is huge. It‚Äôs a huge impact on people‚Äôs lives. People taking care of these tickets will help some people get housing, get a job, be able to take care of their families.‚Äù

298,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1513,Identity Theft Case in Kansas,,,Criminal,"By ROXANA HEGEMAN &nbsp;&nbsp;Associated Press &nbsp;Oct. 23, 2012WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - When Candida L. Gutierrez's identity was stolen, the thief didn't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts. She assumed Gutierrez's persona completely, using it to get a job, a driver's license, a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children.All the while, the crook claimed the real Gutierrez was the one who had stolen her identity. The women's unusual tug-of-war puts a face on ""total identity theft,"" a brazen form of the crime in which con artists go beyond financial fraud to assume many other aspects of another person's life.The scheme has been linked to illegal immigrants who use stolen Social Security numbers to get paid at their jobs, and authorities fear the problem could soon grow to ensnare more unsuspecting Americans.""When she claimed my identity and I claimed it back, she was informed that I was claiming it too,"" said Gutierrez, a 31-year-old Houston elementary school teacher. ""She knew I was aware and that I was trying to fight, and yet she would keep fighting. It is not like she realized and she stopped. No, she kept going, and she kept going harder.""A 32-year-old illegal immigrant named Benita Cardona-Gonzalez is accused of using Gutierrez's identity during a 10-year period when she worked at a Topeka company that packages refrigerated foods.For years, large numbers of illegal immigrants have filled out payroll forms using their real names but stolen Social Security numbers. However, as electronic employment verification systems such as E-Verify become more common, the use of fake numbers is increasingly difficult. Now prosecutors worry that more people will try to fool the systems by assuming full identities rather than stealing the numbers alone.For victims, total identity theft can also have serious health consequences if electronic medical records linked to Social Security numbers get mixed up, putting at risk the accuracy of important patient information such as blood types or life-threatening allergies.Prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else's identity, the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes&nbsp;other than just working.Federal Trade Commission statistics show that Americans reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011, up from 251,100 a year earlier. While it is unclear how many of those cases involve total identity theft, one possible indicator is the number of identity theft complaints that involve more than one type of identity theft - 13 percent last year, compared with 12 percent a year earlier.Nationwide, employment-related fraud accounted for 8 percent of identity theft complaints last year. But in states with large immigrant populations, employment-related identity fraud was much higher: 25 percent in Arizona, 15 percent in Texas, 16 percent in New Mexico, 12 percent in California.Prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else's identity, the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes other than just working.Once they have become established in a community, identity thieves don't want to live in the shadows and they seek a normal life like everybody else. That's when they take the next step and get a driver's license, a home loan and health insurance.""And so that is a natural progression, and that is what we are seeing,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson, who is prosecuting the case against Gutierrez's alleged impostor.Gutierrez first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago. Now each year she trudges to the Social Security Administration with her birth certificate, driver's license, passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record.She spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus, fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history. Her tax records are a mess. She even once phoned the impostor's Kansas employer in a futile effort to find some relief.Both women claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration turned down the request from Gutierrez, instead issuing a new number to the woman impersonating her. And in another ironic twist, Gutierrez was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants.""It is such a horrible nightmare,"" Gutierrez said. ""You get really angry, and then you start realizing anger is not going to help. ... But when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life, it is really such a super big inconvenience. You have to find the time for someone who is abusing you.""When Gutierrez recently got married, her husband began researching identity theft on the Internet and stumbled across identity theft cases filed against other illegal immigrants working at Reser's Fine Foods, the same manufacturer where Cardona-Gonzalez worked. He contacted federal authorities in Kansas and asked them to investigate the employee working there who had stolen his wife's identity.The alleged impostor was arrested in August, 2012, and her fingerprints confirmed that immigration agents had encountered Cardona-Gonzalez in 1996 in Harlingen, Texas, and sent her back to Mexico.Cardona-Gonzalez did not respond to a letter sent to her at the Butler County jail, where she is awaiting trial on charges of aggravated identity theft, misuse of a Social Security number and production of a false document.Her attorney, Matthew Works, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Court filings indicate the two sides are negotiating a plea agreement.Citing privacy issues, the Social Security Administration declined to discuss the Gutierrez case. Reser's Fine Foods did not return a message left at its Topeka plant.Anderson expects more cases of total identity theft ""because we all know what is going on out there - which is thousands and thousands of people who are working illegally in the United States under false identities, mostly of U.S. citizens, and very little is being done about it. But we are doing something about it, one case at a time.""Copyright 2012 The Associated Press.&nbsp;",

Expungement is the removal of an arrest or conviction from a person‚Äôs criminal record.

What records can be expunged?

Arrest records, criminal convictions, and juvenile adjudications can all be expunged in Kansas.

What arrest records can be expunged in Kansas?

An arrest record can be expunged if:


	The arrest occurred because of mistaken identity;
	A court found there was no probable cause for the arrest;

THE WICHITA EAGLE

02/21/2015 6:56 PM&nbsp;

Samuel Carlisle was always going to be a military man. Years of ROTC training drilled that into his head.

‚ÄúI did almost everything I could do freshman year, then halfway through my sophomore year I get told by an Army recruiter, ‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt take you because you‚Äôre a dope fiend,‚Äô‚Äù said Carlisle, 17.

He said he began hanging out in ‚Äúsmoker‚Äôs alley,‚Äù lighting up cigarettes and marijuana at Wichita East High School before transferring to Wichita West. Then one day he got caught with a part of a marijuana joint in his wallet, landing him a drug charge in juvenile court.

But now, he may be getting a second chance.

Face Forward, a program sponsored by Kansas Big Brothers Big Sisters, provides free legal expungement and diversion services for juveniles who qualify ‚Äì essentially wiping the slate clean for people who may have made a one-time mistake as a kid.

It is funded to help 125 people. So far, it has helped 20.

‚ÄúWe love the kids we have, but we have the funds to help more,‚Äù said Janice Wright, director of innovative programs at the charity.

In July 2013, the charity received a nearly $1 million grant directly from the Department of Labor to fund the Face Forward program from 2014 to 2015. It is part of the charity‚Äôs Positive Pathways program, which provides legal services, job coaching skills and other mentoring services to help youth overcome the stigma of juvenile convictions.

Resolve barriers to employment and housing with help from KLS.

They open doors

Kevin Benson, 24, also found a new career through the program after a troubled past. He said he realized he needed help after being rejected by the military because of prior juvenile charges.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really care, you know, I was just living,‚Äù Benson said. ‚ÄúI was just a kid, man.‚Äù

He and his brother entered the foster care system when he was 14, he said. By the time he left the system at 18, he had lived in at least five cities with different families.

On his 17th birthday, he was charged with possession of marijuana.

‚ÄúAfter that, I starting doing it more, and regularly drinking,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI moved to Texas in 2011 and got into harder drugs and more alcohol.‚Äù

After some time in the Job Corps, and then some time homeless, Benson was referred to the Face Forward program. He has since found a job at GameStop and works for area leadership camps, he said.

‚ÄúIt really showed me things I didn‚Äôt realize were out there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey open doors, and they help you obtain things you wouldn‚Äôt be able to otherwise.‚Äù

About half of the youth in Face Forward are filing for expungements, like Benson, and half are in diversion programs, like Carlisle.

Qualifying for expungement is one thing.

Paying the legal fees associated with the procedure is another.

‚ÄúAn attorney has to investigate, find charges, determine if they‚Äôre eligible, and then they have to go to court and have a hearing,‚Äù Wright said. ‚ÄúFor our youth, the average is about $1,800.‚Äù

Wright said Face Forward‚Äôs 2014 rate at which its youth relapse into crime post-intervention was 2 percent. From 2012 to 2013, the rate was 1 percent, she said.

On average, similar programs funded by the Department of Labor have a 36 percent relapse rate, she said.

Benson said as soon as his expungement paperwork is filed, he‚Äôs ready to get on with his life.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really think about this stuff,‚Äù Benson said. ‚ÄúI just try to forget about it. It was a lot of crap that happened in my life.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to look to the future, when things change.‚Äù

Expungement and the law

In Kansas, juveniles are not ‚Äúconvicted‚Äù of crimes. They receive adjudications, which may legally be expunged, or erased, from their criminal records under certain circumstances once they turn 18.

Sometimes juveniles can receive diversions for minor offenses before going to court, so that the adjudication will stay off of his or her criminal record altogether. Typically a diversion program can last six to 12 months, Wright said.

On many job and housing applications, the questions ‚Äì ‚ÄúHave you ever been convicted of a crime?‚Äù or sometimes, ‚ÄúHave you ever been arrested?‚Äù ‚Äì can be damning to applicants with a criminal history, even if they haven‚Äôt technically been convicted of anything, Wright said.

‚ÄúIt feels like a bit of a trip-up for our youth,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor our juveniles especially, it catches them. If it‚Äôs just asking if they‚Äôve been convicted, it‚Äôs no. But they think they have to check it.‚Äù

Juvenile adjudications do not automatically disappear once the person turns 18. Unless they are expunged, they have the potential to follow the individual and complicate applying for jobs, housing or even higher education, Wright said.

Eligibility

The offender is eligible to apply for expungement of juvenile charges if one of two conditions have been met:

The offender turns 23, or if two years have elapsed since the completion of his or her sentence and no new charges are pending.

If a juvenile under 18 is applying for expungement, it must be done by a parent or guardian, said Ron Paschal, chief attorney in the Sedgwick County District Attorney‚Äôs Juvenile Division.

However, there are caveats. Serious person crimes such as murder, rape, manslaughter and child abuse cannot be expunged.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre trying to do in the juvenile system is recognize that kids sometimes do things that do not present the best judgment,‚Äù Paschal said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an opportunity for them to kind of clean up their background so it doesn‚Äôt negatively affect their future as adults. That‚Äôs what the statute is geared to do.‚Äù

According to state law, entities such as private detective agencies, prosecuting attorneys and the military can still access expunged records if requested.

City Council member Lavonta Williams said one of her main priorities is to help disadvantaged youth gain employment in Wichita. If it can lead to employment, Williams said, expungement is a positive thing.

‚ÄúI realize that some people make mistakes, but I don‚Äôt think they should continue to have to pay for the rest of their lives,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a proponent of giving a person a second chance.‚Äù

Kansas Legal Services - Wichita participates in the grant and does some of the legal work on the program.

‚ÄòBan the box‚Äô

In recent years, a movement known as ‚Äúban the box‚Äù on applications has gained momentum in many states ‚Äì referring to the box asking job applicants to check whether they have ever been convicted of a crime.

Thirteen states have passed statewide ‚Äúban the box‚Äù laws. Kansas is not one of them.

But Williams says the city of Wichita may soon be included in the list of more than 60 cities that don‚Äôt include the boxes on their job applications. Currently, applications for jobs within City Hall don‚Äôt ask about the applicant‚Äôs criminal history, but some jobs outside the building still include the box, Williams said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely going to talk about this a little bit more as the city goes through this. ‚Ä¶ When we have gotten through all of the hurdles that we have, we were planning on making it public that that is something that we‚Äôre working on,‚Äù Williams said.

Kansas City, Kan., passed a ‚Äúban the box‚Äù ordinance in November, becoming the first city the state to do so.

Community activists say passing ‚Äúban the box‚Äù ordinances encourages fair hiring practices, essentially prohibiting an employer from rejecting an job-seeker strictly based on what‚Äôs on the application.

severity of crimes",Criminal,"Changes went into effect July 1, 2015&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Severity of Crimes and Expungement chart. &nbsp;The chart shows how soon a criminal record may be expunged. The waiting times are for after all jail time, probation and parole is served.&nbsp;You can see and/or download the chart here.

The chart gives the waiting period before different crimes can be erased from your record. There are several changes which may affect some persons wishing to legally clear their records.


	A major change is for a first offense of driving under the influence (DUI). Now DUI needs only&nbsp;five years&nbsp;of waiting time before it can be legally expunged from a record. The waiting time used to be ten years.
	Another change is for first offense of ""Failure to submit to test for drugs/alcohol."" This crime also requires&nbsp;five years&nbsp;before it can be expunged.&nbsp;


Secord offenses of either driving under the influence or failure to agree to test for drugs/alcohol will still need a waiting period of&nbsp;ten years. Third, fourth and further offenses will also need ten years.


	For a non-grid&nbsp;felony&nbsp;committed after 07/01/1993, based on current non-drug grid with a severity level of 6 through 10.
	
		The chart states that these cases will need&nbsp;three years&nbsp;of waiting after the sentence (parole,&nbsp;probation&nbsp;and jail time).
	
	
	For a non-grid&nbsp;felony&nbsp;committed after 07/01/1993,&nbsp;based on current non-drug grid with a severity level of 1 through 5.
	
		These cases will need&nbsp;five years&nbsp;of waiting after the sentence (parole,&nbsp;probation&nbsp;and jail time) .
	
	


A severity level 4 Drug Crime, committed after 07/01/2012 will need a waiting period of&nbsp;five years. Previously the waiting time was three years.


	This shows that drug crimes more recently committed are held to be more severe.


A severity level 4 Drug Crime committed between 07/01/1993 and 07/01/2012 will still need a waiting period of&nbsp;three years.

A severity level 5 Drug Crime&nbsp;committed after 07/01/2012 will need a waiting period of&nbsp;three years. &nbsp;


	This is a new category which includes possession or growing of a controlled substance. To learn more about the details, ask an attorney.
	The Kansas Sentencing Commission&nbsp;says that: ""All possession offenses are now severity level five.&nbsp; Severity levels for possession with intent to distribute and distribution are dependent on quantity of the controlled substance.""&nbsp;


Crimes that may not be expunged have remained the same including rape, capital murder, abuse of a child, etc.


	They are all listed on&nbsp;the chart.

clearing record",Criminal,"By Rosie Flores, an Activist Mom &nbsp;Sept. 4, 2015 &nbsp;from TalkPoverty.org

Americans believe in the idea that everyone should get a&nbsp;second chance‚Äîa chance to redeem ourselves and make things right. This is a guiding principle behind a ‚Äúsecond chance economy‚Äù‚Äîone that would offer&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;for approximately 650,000 people released from prison every year in America, and for tens of millions of others who have been arrested or convicted of a crime.

I‚Äôm one of those Americans who committed a crime and have a criminal conviction. At one point, I was just like the&nbsp;two-thirds&nbsp;of people who are released from prison or jail only to commit a crime again, be rearrested and convicted.

I know some people may say that I deserve to live in poverty because of my mistakes.

But they don‚Äôt know my story. They don‚Äôt know that I was born to an abusive father and a mother with severe mental illness; or that I was given narcotics as a young child by a relative who was supposed to care for me, but instead molested me and sold my pictures through a child pornography ring. They don‚Äôt know that by the time I was 12, I was on the streets, on my way to a life of crime and addiction, and‚Äîwith no adult to care for me or advocate for me‚ÄîI was in and out of the juvenile justice system, never receiving the&nbsp;mental health care&nbsp;I needed.

Truth is, I don‚Äôt care if people know these things about me or not, because I love myself now and that is what matters. But I do care that people have&nbsp;another chance after their arrest or conviction.

I‚Äôm on the right track now, doing right by myself, my god, my family and my community.

One of the ways I‚Äôm giving back to my community is by working to create an economy that includes me and others who have served our time and are following the rules of probation or parole.&nbsp; A&nbsp;study&nbsp;released by the Vera Institute of Justice found that states across the country are giving people like me a second chance not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it will reduce crime and prison costs by preventing recidivism.

One obstacle to opportunity that many states are addressing is the lifetime ban on receiving public benefits and job assistance through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for people who have a prior drug-related felony conviction. Research has shown that this policy&nbsp;increases recidivism and crime&nbsp;and is also&nbsp;harmful&nbsp;to children as well as adults who are trying to start over.&nbsp;

In addition to causing hunger and hardship, it can also&nbsp;prevent people from getting the mental health or substance abuse treatment they need, as many of these programs rely on public assistance funding to pay individuals‚Äô room and board. Repeal of this harmful policy has been supported by the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Los Angeles Times, and is included in the&nbsp;REDEEM Act, bipartisan legislation co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Rand Paul.

Federal law already allows states to waive or modify the ban, and many have done so.

For example, this April,&nbsp;California lifted the lifetime ban&nbsp;on TANF and SNAP so that people with a felony drug conviction who are complying with their probation or parole are now eligible for nutrition assistance, income support, and job training. Approximately 6,000 families in the state now experience hunger less often, have access to job training and employment services, and their children are no longer denied child care.

For me, the biggest change is the child care help that I am able to receive for the first time. After my release and getting sober, it was hard to build a new life with my son when he was denied childcare because of my conviction. Not only was it hard for me to find work‚Äîhe missed out on the great opportunities offered through childcare&nbsp;programs.

In June,&nbsp;Texas&nbsp;modified its lifetime ban so that people with a felony drug conviction are now eligible for SNAP (although a parole violation would lead to a ‚Äútwo-year disqualification‚Äù, and a second felony drug conviction would result in a lifetime ban).&nbsp; Last year, Missourians took similar action so that people with felony drug convictions are able to receive nutrition assistance while participating in substance abuse treatment, as long as they are following the rules of probation or parole.&nbsp; While&nbsp;fourteen&nbsp;states including California have opted out of the lifetime ban entirely, two-thirds of states continue to enforce the ban‚Äîor a modified version of it, as in Texas and Missouri.

In my opinion, no one should go hungry for a crime that they have served time for, especially if they are following the rules now.

I‚Äôve gone hungry and it is an experience no human should have to go through

‚Äîespecially not in America, since we have the resources to prevent hunger. Being hungry also doesn‚Äôt help people who have had an addiction&nbsp;stay straight, or stay away from crime.

This is why I have worked with a whole bunch of&nbsp;people and organizations&nbsp;over the past couple of years to end this unfair and unsafe lifetime ban on assistance. It isn‚Äôt easy telling my story to others, but it has made a difference. Sometimes I forget how messed up my childhood was and how far I‚Äôve come, but I will never forget this harmful policy, how it made me feel, and how it made me feel to end it.

By the Council of State Governments Justice Center

On the heels of the 15th Annual Kansas Workforce Summit in late January, 2016, representatives from more than 62 local Sedgwick County, Kansas, businesses gathered in Wichita to discuss hiring people with criminal records.

Designed for corporate leaders, the forum featured two panels of local Kansas employers and members of community and state agencies.

The director of the CSG Justice Center‚Äôs Corrections and Reentry division, Stefan LoBuglio also spoke about the national perspective on employment and reentry.

In Kansas, four out of nine people possess a criminal record. Although the Wichita City Council voted in July 2015 to ‚Äúban the box‚Äù that asks whether applicants have a criminal record on its job applications‚Äîfollowing the lead of dozens of other states and hundreds of cities and counties ‚Äîthere‚Äôs still more to be done, said panelist and Wichita City Council member LaVonta Williams.

‚Äú[The City of Wichita is] proud of what we have done, but we have a way to go,‚Äù she said during the panel discussion.

‚ÄúI hope that we can help individuals understand that there is hope when they come out of incarceration.‚Äù


In Kansas, four out of nine people possess a criminal record.


Cory Brock, an employment retention and workforce development specialist with the Kansas Department of Corrections (DOC), explained the process of matching people leaving prison with appropriate jobs. This, he said, is achieved through collaboration between the DOC and community-based organizations, such as the Wichita Workforce Center, which connects DOC staff with local business owners.

Kurt Level, associate general counsel of labor and employment for Koch Industries‚Äîwhich has also ‚Äúbanned the box‚Äù on its employment applications‚Äîsaid the corporation has been successful in hiring employees with criminal records, while also navigating the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission‚Äôs guidelines.

‚ÄúWe think it should be about reform and redemption,‚Äù Level said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to employers to give individuals a second chance‚Ä¶Nothing stops recidivism like a job.‚Äù

The forum was hosted by the Workforce Alliance of South Central Kansas, in conjunction with the Wichita Metro Chamber of Commerce and the Wichita Society for Human Resource Management and is part of the growing conversation across the country between business leaders and policymakers on improving employment outcomes for individuals with criminal records. It is modeled on an event held in June 2014 at the White House and is inspired by ‚ÄúState Pathways to Prosperity,‚Äù an initiative of The Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center, which is supported by the CSG Justice Center‚Äôs&nbsp;Reentry and Employment project.

expungment
fair housing",Criminal,"April 11, 2016

By the CSG Justice Center

Criminal records are a significant barrier to housing for millions of Americans. Last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued&nbsp;groundbreaking guidance&nbsp;stating that admission denials, evictions, and other adverse housing decisions based on a person‚Äôs criminal record may constitute racial discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.&nbsp;

On April 4, the Office of General Counsel at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued ‚ÄúGuidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records,‚Äù which states that the broad exclusion of people with criminal records in the sale or rental of housing or other real estate transactions may be in violation of the Fair Housing Act.

The&nbsp;Fair Housing Act&nbsp;(FHA) prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, or financing of housing based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, family status, or national origin. Because of the well-documented disproportionate rates of criminal justice contact in the U.S. for black and Hispanic Americans, the restriction of housing based on criminal records can consequently have a disproportionate impact on minorities, the new guidance says.

‚ÄúWhen landlords summarily refuse to rent to anyone who has an arrest record, they may effectively and disproportionately bar the door to millions of folks of color for no good reason at all,‚Äù said HUD Secretary Julian Castro in a&nbsp;statement.

A housing policy that has a disproportionate effect on minorities may be in violation of the FHA even if there is no explicit intent to discriminate, according to the guidance. In cases where a policy disproportionately restricted housing for a minority population, even if none was intended, the burden is on the housing provider to justify the policy as necessary for a ‚Äúsubstantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest.‚Äù However, the guidance states that ‚Äúarbitrary and overbroad criminal history-related bans are likely to lack a legally sufficient justification.‚Äù


The majority of people with criminal records are people of color -- keeping them from housing because of their records is as bad as discriminating because of race.


HUD‚Äôs guidance on FHA compliance and the allowable use of criminal records in rental and real estate decisions comes on the heels of additional guidance related to the use of criminal records in housing decisions. In November 2015, HUD released&nbsp;Notice PIH 2015-19&nbsp;that excludes the use of arrest records in housing decisions for public housing agencies and owners of federally assisted housing. In March 2016, HUD released a&nbsp;supplemental FAQ&nbsp;to Notice PIH 2015-19 to further clarify that an arrest itself ‚Äúdoes not prove that a person engaged in disqualifying criminal activity, poses a threat, or otherwise violated admission standards‚Äù for public housing.

On April 9, the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;ran an&nbsp;editorial supporting the new guidance. According to theTimes, ‚Äúthe guidelines make clear that landlords cannot use arrests‚Äîwhich quite often do not lead to conviction‚Äîto disqualify applicants, and must consider the nature and severity of convictions in evaluating rental applicants and prove that any exclusions are justified.‚Äù

criminal record",Criminal,"This information is from the Kansas Criminal Defense Law website.

The Kansas statute, K.S.A. 21-3110, says that a defendant in a criminal action may have their conviction or arrest wiped off their record so that only the defendant or government agencies have access to it.

In order to get the expungement of an arrest record, K.S.A. 22-2410 requires a lawsuit must be filed in the same court as the conviction and must give the following information:

(1) The petitioner's full name;

(2) the full name of the petitioner at the time of arrest, if different than the current name;

(3) the petitioner's sex, race and date of birth;

(4) the crime for which the petitioner was arrested;

(5) the date of the petitioner's arrest; and

(6) the identity of the arresting law enforcement agency.

An expungement lawsuit requires a docket fee of about $195, unless the petitioner was involved in identity theft.


Once you have gotten your personal record details in hand,&nbsp;go here to read about a free form&nbsp;offered by Kansas Legal Services to help with expungement.


The arresting agency and the prosecuting attorney will be notified of the petition and be given an opportunity to be heard at a hearing on the petition. Any person who may have relevant information about the petitioner may testify at the hearing. The court may inquire into the background of the petitioner.

If the presiding judge orders expungement of an arrest record and/or further court proceedings, if any, the Order will repeat the information in the petition and will state the required findings that support the grounds for expungement. &nbsp;The findings can be:


	The arrest occurred because of mistaken identity;
	a court has found that there was no probable cause for the arrest;
	the petitioner was found not guilty in court proceedings; or
	the expungement would be in the best interests of justice and charges have been dismissed; or no charges have been or are likely to be filed.


The court clerk will send a certified copy of the judge's order to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation which will notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary of Corrections and any other criminal justice agency which may have a record of the arrest.

If an Expungement Order is entered, the petitioner/defendant will be treated as not having been arrested.

In order to qualify for expungement, you must not have been involved in any criminal activity within the preceeding two years and you must set forth all the details of the underlying conviction.

At least three years must have passed since the successful completion of any underlying sentence including probation and parole. These are the determing factors for convictions ranked level four and below on the drug grid and level six and below on the non-drug grid.

Crimes ranked more serious than this require a five year waiting period.

The following convictions require five (5) years time passage before expungement:


	Vehicular homicide, as defined by K.S.A. 21-3405, and amendments;
	driving with a license that has been canceled, suspended or revoked, as prohibited by K.S.A. 8-262, and amendments;
	perjury resulting from a violation of K.S.A. 8-261a, and amendments;
	a violation of the provisions of the fifth clause of K.S.A. 8-142, and amendments--relating to fraudulent applications;
	any felony that includes a vehicle;
	failing to stop at the scene of an accident and perform the duties required by K.S.A. 8-1602, 8-1603 or 8-1604, and amendments;
	a violation of the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3104, and amendments, relating to having up-to-date motor vehicle liability insurance coverage; or
	a violation of K.S.A. 21-3405b, and amendments.


There are no expungement of convictions or diversions for a violation of a city ordinance.

K.S.A. 21-4619 says that neither arrests nor convictions for the following crimes can be expunged:


	Rape,
	indecent liberties with a child,
	aggravated indecent liberties with a child,
	criminal sodomy involving children,
	aggravated criminal sodomy,
	indecent solicitation of a child,
	aggravated indecent solicitation of a child,
	sexual exploitation of a child,
	aggravated incest,
	endangering a child,
	abuse of a child,
	any form of murder or manslaughter,
	sexual battery when the victim is less than 18 years of age,
	aggravated sexual battery


or any crime comparable to any of these offenses.

Student Loans
College
University",Education,"In certain cases, the federal government will cancel all or part of an educational loan. This practice is called&nbsp;Loan Forgiveness. Here are some programs out there and how to access them.


A. Perform volunteer work

These volunteer groups offer loan forgiveness:


	AmeriCorps. Serve for 12 months and receive up to $7400 in stipends plus $4725 to be used towards your loan.
	Peace Corps. Volunteers may apply for deferment of Stafford, Perkins and Consolidation loans and partial repeal of Perkins Loans (15% for each year of service, up to 70% in total). Volunteers make a real difference in the lives of real people with two years of service in more than 70 developing countries.
	Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA). Volunteer with private, non-profit groups that help wipe out hunger, homelessness, poverty and illiteracy. Provide 1700 hours of service and receive $4725.



B. Perform military service


	Students who are in the&nbsp;Army National Guard may be suitable for their Student Loan Repayment Program, which offers up to $10,000.

	
		Note: The military and veterans' groups offer many scholarships and tuition assistance programs. See the section on&nbsp;Military Aid&nbsp;at Finaid.org or the Education Section at Military.com for details.
	
	



C. Teach in certain types of communities


	Students who become full-time teachers in an elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families can have a part of their&nbsp;Stafford or PLUS loans&nbsp;forgiven under The National Defense Education Act. This program forgives up to $17,500 of the remaining loan balance.
	The American Federation of Teachers maintains a list of other&nbsp;loan forgiveness programs for teachers.



D. Legal or medical studies


	Legal Studies:
	
		Many law schools forgive the loans of students who&nbsp;serve in public interest or non-profit positions.
		
			For more info, contact&nbsp;Equal Justice Works.
			The American Bar Association (ABA) also has a summary of&nbsp;Loan Repayment Assistance Programs (LRAP),&nbsp;Directory of Law School Loan Repayment Assistance Programs (LRAP)&nbsp;and&nbsp;State Loan Repayment Assistance Programs.
		
		
	
	
	Medical Studies:
	
		The US Department of Health and Human Services offers loan forgiveness programs through the&nbsp;National Health Service Corps&nbsp;and the Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program.
		
			These programs offer loan forgiveness to doctors and registered nurses. They must agree to&nbsp;practice for a set number of years in areas that lack decent medical care (including remote and/or economically depressed regions).
		
		
		The US National Institutes of Health's&nbsp;NIH Loan Repayment Programs repays up to $35,000/year of student loan debt for US citizens who are conducting clinical medical research.
		The US Department of Agriculture's&nbsp;Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP)&nbsp;offers loan forgiveness of $25,000 per year for three years.
		
			It is offered for veterinarians who commit to work in a veterinary shortage area for three years.
		
		
		Many hospitals and private healthcare facilities use loan forgiveness to recruit&nbsp;occupational and physical therapists.&nbsp;
		
			Contact the American Physical Therapy Association&nbsp;or the&nbsp;American Occupational Therapy Association.
		
		
		Other loan repayment programs for medical school students include:
		
			Nicholas J. Pisacano MD Memorial Foundation Inc.&nbsp;(American Board of Family Practice)
			HRSA Faculty Loan Repayment Program
			Indian Health Service (IHS) Loan Repayment Program
			US Air Force, Army, and Navy Financial Assistance Programs
			The American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) maintains a database of&nbsp;state and other loan repayment programs for medical school students.
		
		
	
	



E. Meet other traits specified by Federal government loan forgiveness programs


	See the US Department of Education's pages on&nbsp;Cancellation/Deferment Options for Teachers.
	Also, the US Department of Education maintains a database of&nbsp;low-income schools eligible for teacher loan cancellation for Perkins and Stafford loans.
	Visit the HRSA web site for info on&nbsp;Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program
	The&nbsp;Federal Student Loan Repayment Program&nbsp;allows federal agencies to set up loan forgiveness programs to help recruit and keep employees.
	
		This is a loan repayment program and not a loan forgiveness program. The agencies make payments directly to the loan holder and the payments represent taxable income to the employee.
		The agencies can repay up to $10,000 in Federal student loans per employee per calendar year, with a collective max of $60,000 per employee.
	
	
	See also FinAid's&nbsp;Public Service Loan Forgiveness&nbsp;section.

Iep",Education,"What is Special Education?

Special education means uniquely designed instruction to meet the one-of-a-kind needs of an exceptional child. It is provided at no cost to parents (K.S.A. 72-962(i)).


	Once a child is found to be suited for special education, a written plan will be prepared describing the educational programs the child will receive.
	
		This plan is called an Individualized Education Program (IEP).
	
	
	An IEP must be ready&nbsp;before the child‚Äôs placement in a special education program.
	
		The school district must get the parent‚Äôs written consent before placing the child in a special education program.
	
	


What is an IEP exactly? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

An IEP is a written statement for a unique child that is created, reviewed, and revised to meet standards set up in the policy K.S.A. 72-987.


	The IEP is written by the child‚Äôs IEP team.
	This should include the parent(s) or&nbsp;guardian(s) and any other people important in the child's life.
	It is specially written to meet the child‚Äôs developmental needs and goals.


Who is on the team? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The IEP Team is composed of:&nbsp;


	The parents or guardians of the child;
	At least one regular education teacher of that child;
	At least one special education teacher;
	A skilled and informed rep of the agency directly involved in providing educational services for that child;
	A person who can interpret the teaching effects of the evaluation results;
	Other persons who have knowledge or special skills having to do with the child (optional); and
	Whenever proper, the child (K.S.A. 72-962(u)).


What about the parents of the exceptional child?

The parents or guardians of a gifted child or a child with a disability are expected to be equal players along with school personnel, in creating, reviewing, and revising the IEP of their child.

This role is an active role in which the parents:


	Provide critical info about the strengths of their child and express their concerns for enhancing the education of their child;
	Participate in discussions about the child‚Äôs needs for special education and related services and extra aids and services; and
	Join with the other parties in deciding how the child will be involved and how they will progress in the general curriculum.
	Also deciding how the child will take part in State and district-wide assessments, what services the agency will offer to the child and in what setting.


If you feel your child‚Äôs educational performance is not good enough, you may ask that he or she be re-assessed. Your child must always be re-evaluated before any serious change in his or her placement can occur.

At a minimum, your child must be re-assessed in all areas related to a suspected disability at least once every three years. If you are still not satisfied, you can start&nbsp;due process.

What is due process?

Due process&nbsp;means a fair procedure must be used for making decisions. In special education,&nbsp;due process&nbsp;refers to how a parent may appeal decisions made about the evaluation, suitability, educational program, or placement of the child.

Due process&nbsp;may be achieved through a formal hearing conducted by a neutral hearing officer.

It may also include&nbsp;mediation, which is a way of casually resolving the dispute without a formal hearing.&nbsp;Mediation&nbsp;can only occur if both the parents and the school district agree to it. A lawyer is not needed for&nbsp;mediation.

A formal hearing is more difficult to do without a lawyer. You may want to ask an attorney for advice about whether to try&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;or a formal hearing.

What should the IEP contain? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The IEP shall include:


	A statement of the child‚Äôs present level of school success and functional performance;
	A statement of measurable annual goals;
	A description of how the child‚Äôs progress towards meeting the annual goals will be measured and when reports will be provided;
	Explanation of the extent, if any, to which the child will not take part with non-exceptional children in the regular class.
	
		In other words, a description on whether or not your child will be in a classroom with non-exceptional children and if they are in the classroom, how long will they be in the ""regular"" classroom every day,
	
	
	Explanation of any changes to or adaptations of state or district-wide assessments; or whether or not changes in tests will help your child progress, and what will they be;
	Anticipated dates of services (frequency, location, duration); or how often, where and how long your child will receive services each day;
	And postsecondary goals for children over 14, or where your child will go after graduating (College? &nbsp;Vocational rehab? &nbsp;Other training?)
	A statement of the special education and related services and added aids, based on peer-reviewed research (proven to be effective), to be provided to the child.
	A statement that the child has been informed of his or her child‚Äôs rights, if any, that will transfer to him or her on reaching the age of majority as provided in K.S.A. 72-989(c).


Changes in special education laws regarding IEP's

Whether you are already aware of IEP‚Äôs or are just learning about them, you may want to also get to know some changes made to the IEP process.

Some of the changes made in 2005 about special education law in Kansas included:


	A school district may not have its attorney present at the IEP meeting unless the parents have an attorney at the meeting as well;
	The meaning of parent was expanded to include foster parents, if they are appointed (and agree to be) the education advocate of an exceptional child;
	The school district has a duty to find disabled children that are homeless and those who have limited skill in English;
	All records of an exceptional child who transfers from one school district to another must be transferred with the child or as soon thereafter as possible;
	Parental consent is needed for assessment and for the initial provision of services; and
	The child‚Äôs IEP must also include fitting postsecondary education goals based on age-appropriate transition assessments for exceptional children.

criminal record
clean slate
record expungement",Employment,"For the last four years, Paul has faced significant obstacles in securing steady employment, despite having a high school diploma and a year of college education under his belt. Paul applied to positions at Walmart, McDonalds, different security companies ‚Äì any opening he learned of during his frequent visits to a local career center. Time and again, Paul was turned down and told he wasn‚Äôt qualified.

To change all that, Paul completed a construction apprenticeship program. Less than two weeks after he graduated, Paul had strong prospects with a construction company and a major utility company. Amidst all this good news, however, Paul received a letter that brought his forward momentum to a halt.

A ‚ÄúNotice of Proposed Revocation‚Äù

informed Paul that his driver‚Äôs license could be revoked because of overdue child support payments. Paul had known about the child support order, but it simply wasn‚Äôt something he could afford to pay. The amount was based on his salary at a job he had lost more than a year before the order was set. Paul made cash payments directly to the child‚Äôs mother whenever he could, not realizing that those payments ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt count‚Äù because he was supposed to make them through the District government. After months without income he ran out of money to make any payments. But if Paul lost his license, none of the positions for which he now qualified would be available to him, and he‚Äôd be right back where he started ‚Äì unable to pay his child support. Now what?

We must break the underlying legal barriers to employment.

It is no secret that getting and keeping a stable job, let alone a job that pays a living wage, is already a challenge for far too many people living in poverty across the nation. Black workers and young workers&nbsp;were hit particularly hard&nbsp;by the recession, and unemployment rates for several groups of workers remain high today, including those without a college degree. While the overall unemployment level in Washington, D.C., is&nbsp;7.5%, unemployment levels in Wards 5, 7, and 8 hover in the 15 to 20% range, with poverty rates&nbsp;as high as&nbsp;25% (Ward 7) and 34% (Ward 8).

D.C. residents and advocates have improved the pathway to jobs with decent wages in part through successful efforts to&nbsp;raise the minimum wage, strengthen&nbsp;wage theft laws, remove&nbsp;criminal history questions&nbsp;from job applications, and develop employment training programs like the construction apprenticeship sought out by Paul. But, as Paul‚Äôs story reveals, these efforts aren‚Äôt always enough.

Among the legal barriers to employment are:

criminal or arrest records, poor or inaccurate credit reports, child support arrears and suspended drivers‚Äô licenses, domestic violence, prior homelessness or lack of stable housing, and other issues that may appear unrelated to employment. These barriers may distract even the most dedicated job seekers from their search, prevent a skill-based assessment of their application, threaten the credentials that make them eligible for sought-after positions, and hinder their ability to keep employment once it is secured.

As Paul‚Äôs story shows, overdue child support payments can cause job seekers to lose their driver‚Äôs licenses, contribute to negative credit reports, and ultimately can lead to jail time. Prior arrests and convictions may cause employers to reject an applicant without ever assessing whether that conviction is relevant to job performance. Ongoing domestic violence, custody disputes, unstable housing, and financial instability due to debt and predatory lending can all cause significant disruption to job searches and job retention.

For example, how does someone who is homeless

or couch surfing receive information from potential employers? Or complete an application form that requires an address? Or maintain appropriate clothing for an interview?&nbsp; How can a mother whose children are chronically ill from sub-standard housing conditions avoid absenteeism?&nbsp; The longer these issues persist, the more likely they are to affect job seekers and workers who lack other resources to help them cope with financial stress. &nbsp;And what happens when these vulnerable workers do not receive the wages they are due or are subject to excessive garnishments?

What legal aid can do

These concerns do not need to be faced alone. In many cases, civil legal services can help remove these barriers by:


	Securing the restoration of driver‚Äôs licenses
	Overcoming problems associated with arrest or conviction records, including record sealing, improper employer inquiries, mistaken identities or other inaccuracies
	Providing information about credit records, correcting inaccuracies, and advising how to respond to prospective employer inquiries
	Advocating for individuals whose child support payments are set unreasonably high or have become overdue, particularly when the individual is threatened with incarceration or loss of a driver‚Äôs license
	Securing protection or resolving problems associated with domestic violence, child custody disputes, and child support
	Improving and stabilizing housing and addressing health problems affecting family members, including those caused by dangerous living conditions
	Recovering unpaid wages and remedying other forms of workplace mistreatment


Not long after Paul received notice that his driver‚Äôs license might be revoked, his apprenticeship program hosted attorneys from Neighborhood Legal Services Program (NLSP).&nbsp; The attorneys informed the trainees about the civil legal underpinnings of common hurdles facing job seekers. After participating in the presentation, Paul sought NLSP help. &nbsp;An attorney prevented the suspension of Paul‚Äôs license and is now helping him secure a child support payment plan that more closely matches the amount he is currently able to pay. Shortly after he found out his license was safe, Paul got the flagger job on a construction crew, his first full-time position since 2011.

Advocating for a living wage and job training is necessary, but is also insufficient for many people who are seeking to enter or stay in the workforce.&nbsp; That‚Äôs one reason why access to civil legal aid is so critical to workforce development and anti-poverty efforts. Working closely with community groups, social service agencies, and job training programs, civil legal aid programs can help job seekers identify and break these legal barriers to employment.

145,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/235,"Child Custody, Visitation and Support ","Child Custody
Child Support
Visitation",,Family Law,"Custody:

What are the types of custody?

Joint&nbsp;Legal Custody


	Both parties should consult each other about major decisions for the children.
	This includes, but is not limited to: where the children go to school; where they go to church; who their doctors are; if they should be allowed to get piercings, tattoos, etc.; consent to marriage; whether braces are a good idea; whether therapy should be sought; and whether the child should receive certain medications.
	Both parents have equal access to medical and school records.
	Joint&nbsp;Legal Custody&nbsp;is the preferred method of custody in Kansas. It has nothing to do with who the children live with or the amount of time each party spends with the children.


Sole Legal Custody


	The residential parent does not have to consult with the other parent about major decisions for the children.
	Both parents have equal access to medical and school records.
	It does not give the residential parent the right to move the children without notice to the other parent. The parent still must follow the law and give 30 day notice before moving.
	This does not prevent or limit the other party‚Äôs parenting time with the children.
	The Judge must make the finding that there are facts to support the awarding of sole&nbsp;legal custody.


Full Custody&nbsp;- There is no such thing as ‚Äúfull custody‚Äù in Kansas.

Divided custody - This means that one child lives with one parent and another child with the other. Each party has visitation with the child in the custody of the other. It is used in rare cases.

Non-parental custody- This can be granted in the short term if the court believes the parents are unfit or that the child is in need of care and an action will be filed pursuant to the Kansas Code for the Care of Children. Grandparent placement is non-parental custody.

What factors does a judge look at in awarding custody?


	When deciding placement or custody of the minor children, the Court mainly looks at the children‚Äôs best interest, not the parent‚Äôs wishes.
	The Court studies several factors and considers the child‚Äôs best interests to be whatever promotes the children‚Äôs physical and mental health and safety.
	
		The Kansas statute lists the following factors, among others: the child's adjustment to home, school and community; the wishes of the parents and the child; which parent will most cooperate in helping the child keep a bond with the other parent; and evidence of spousal abuse.
	
	



	Neither the mother nor the father is preferred because of sex.
	Each case is reviewed on its own facts according to child's best interests.
	If the child is a teenager, the judge may be willing to consider the child's wishes as to residence and the child's reasons. There is no specific age when a child gets to decide where they live, but normally, the older the child, the more weight that child's desires are given by the court.


Can the parties agree as to the custody plan for their child?


	Yes, the parties may agree on the type of custody that best fits their circumstances. They may then present their agreement to the judge for approval.
	Kansas law provides a presumption that a written agreement between the parties about custody or residency of their minor child is in the child's best interest.


After a Court determines which parent should have the primary residence of a child, can the court ever change that?


	Yes. The Court keeps the power to change the primary residence of a child until the child reaches the age of 18 or graduates from high school, whichever occurs first.
	Generally, if the parties stay in the same state, a motion to change primary custody must be filed in the same court where the divorce or paternity was determined.


What reasons would a court need to change the child's primary residence?


	The law usually requires a material change of circumstances' before a judge will change a custody order.
	Usually the change of circumstances will be something in the residential parent's home that has an adverse impact on the child. This can be changes such as physical abuse, use of illegal drugs, alcohol abuse or neglect.


Visitation:

What is visitation?


	Visitation is the right of the non-residential parent, the parent who does not have residential custody, to spend time and have access to their child.
	The court will sometimes order ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô visitation. This entitles a parent to see the child at sensible times under reasonable conditions, after ample notice. The court then allows the details to be worked out amongst the parents.
	Alternatively, the court may order specific visitation with specific times or places for access to the child.


What happens if the parties cannot work out a schedule or do not follow a schedule ordered by the Court?


	If a case outlining the visitation rights is still pending, then you will need to ask for a temporary order for visitation. If there is a final order on file outlining visitation, then it is a matter of either filing a motion for specific visitation or filing a motion to enforce the current ordered visitation.
	The Court may find a party in contempt of court for refusing to comply or can change the existing order.


Mediation


	Where visitation is an issue, the court can order the parties into mediation or other alternative dispute resolution methods. &nbsp;
	Judges are happiest when the parties work out their issues themselves. In order to promote this, the Court may turn to different forms of dispute resolution, known as ADR, such as:
	
		Mediation&nbsp;‚Äì The parties sit down with a neutral third party who tries to help them reach an agreement about parenting time and custody of the minor children.&nbsp;
		
			It is non-binding and anything that occurs or is said in&nbsp;mediation&nbsp;is confidential.‚Äã
		
		
		Limited Case Management&nbsp;- Process where the parties meet with a trained third party who, upon interviewing the parties, looking at evidence, and interviewing witnesses, makes recommendations to the Court on who the children should live with and the other parties‚Äô parenting time based on statutory factors.
	
	


Can a judge ever prohibit access by a parent?


	A judge may restrict, or even prohibit, access if there is evidence that visitation would be very harmful to the child, as in instances of child abuse.
	Sometimes a Court will order that any visitation be supervised by a third party, such as a social worker, relative or court officer.
	Supervised visitation is sometimes held at locations such as TFI, where parents enter through different doors and visits are watched by experts. These services usually come with a fee, which is often split between the two parents.
	A parent who is banned from seeing a child may, at a later time, petition the Court for visitation if conditions improve.


Courts often give parents the following guidelines about visitation:


	The residential parent should have the child ready at the mutually agreed time.
	The residential parent should encourage and make the child feel good about going to visit the other parent.
	The nonresidential parent should pick up and return the child on time unless there is an emergency or the parent has called ahead.
	The nonresidential parent should tell the other parent as soon as possible if unable to keep visitation.
	The nonresidential parent should make the time spent with the child as pleasant as possible by not questioning the child about the former spouse's activities, or making promises that cannot be kept, not discussing the faults of the other parent, or by making excessive gifts.
	Parents should not argue with each other in front of the child.
	The nonresidential parent should not visit the child after drinking or taking illegal drugs.
	The parent should not visit the child at unreasonable hours or take them to unsafe places.


Can a judge order visitation rights for anyone other than a parent?


	Kansas statutes say that following a divorce, grandparents and step-parents may be granted visitation rights if it is in the best interest of the child.
	In addition, Kansas law allows grandparents to petition for visitation if they have established a substantial relationship with the child or if their child has died and their grandchild has been adopted by a step-parent. The judge has the discretion to make a visitation order.
	
		For more information, see Grandparent Rights.
	
	
	However, natural grandparents do not have a right to visitation when their grandchildren are adopted by third parties, or when the grandparents' child has had his or her parental rights severed.


Child Support:

What is Child Support?

Child support&nbsp;is payment from one parent to the other parent for support of the minor children.


	Child Support&nbsp;may be ordered whether the parties exercise shared residential custody or primary residential custody.&nbsp;
	It is calculated through a formula created by the Kansas Supreme Court. &nbsp;
	
		It is based on the income of the parties, the number of children of the parties, other children that the paying party may be financially responsible for, daycare expenses, and health care expenses.
		The tables are located at&nbsp;www.kscourts.org. There is a&nbsp;child support&nbsp;calculator at&nbsp;www.kansaslegalservices.org.

157,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/255,Spousal Support/Maintenance,Spousal Support,,Family Law,"What Is Spousal Support?


	Spousal Support (also called&nbsp;Alimony&nbsp;or&nbsp;Maintenance) is assistance through money, open to those who were legally married. It is in credit to a partner‚Äôs role in the marriage and to help the recipient spouse achieve independence.
	It is either based on an agreement between the parties or awarded by the court.
	It is not automatically awarded in divorces or separations. The judge has to decide it's needed based on a set of factors.


Factors Considered When Awarding Alimony:


	The court will consider several factors when deciding whether or not to award alimony and, if so, how much to award.
	These factor include:
	
		Duration of the marriage and standard of living created during the marriage;
		The age, physical and emotional conditions of the parties;
		Financial resources of the parties;
		Contributions of each party to the marriage;
		Time needed to obtain the training to find employment; and
		The ability of the payor spouse to meet his/her needs and pay support.
	
	


Types of Maintenance and How It‚Äôs Calculated:


	Maintenance can be in several forms: A lump-sum (one large payment or several installments), periodic payments over a set amount of time, on a percentage of earnings, or ‚Äúon any other basis‚Äù.
	Periodic maintenance paid monthly is the most common plan and the one people often connect with alimony.
	Support in Kansas gets assessed according to a set of guiding principles, regardless of income level. These guidelines, however, are not binding on the court.


Modifying Support:


	The courts retains authority to change a court-ordered maintenance award after the entry of a divorce decree. However, there are some restrictions on the court‚Äôs power to change awards.
	
		There needs to be a material change in circumstances (one that is central and relevant)
		Also, no change that would increase the amount awarded or rush the duty for unpaid maintenance may be made without the consent of the liable party.
	
	
	Courts can reduce awards without the liable party‚Äôs consent, but can‚Äôt increase it without consent.


Duration of Alimony:


	In Kansas, spousal support cannot be awarded for longer than 121 months. However, the parties can agree to a longer term in a property settlement agreement if they chose.
	Court-ordered maintenance ends when either spouse dies or when the recipient spouse remarries.


Enforcement:


	Maintenance can be paid directly to the KPC (Kansas Payment Center). The KPC&nbsp;is the payment processing center for all Kansas child support and maintenance payments.
	Missing a payment can result in a judgment against the payor spouse for each missed payment.
	The judgements can be enforced by:
	
		Garnishing of wages;
		Seizure of bank accounts, real estate, and other non-exempt property; and
		Possibly charging the payor spouse with contempt of court.

1) I want to see my grandchildren, but the parent/legal guardian will not let me, what can I do?

&nbsp;

2) I have defacto custody of my grandchild, and so what do I need to do to set up legal rights so that I can do things a parent would normally do?

I want to see my grandchildren, but the parent/legal guardian will not let me, what can I do? 

Try to work it out between the parties without resorting to legal action. You first have to ask for visits and have it refused. If that doesn‚Äôt work, then the short answer is you have to sue.

Your rights will greatly depend in Kansas on the existing bond you have with your grandchild. To get rights to visitation, you must show a ‚Äúsubstantial relationship‚Äù with the child. The visits must also be shown to be in the best interest of the child. Lastly, the court has to give great weight to the decision of the parents about the issue, unless you can show that their decision is improper or unreasonable.


	
	If the case involves a divorce case, no matter how old, or a paternity case: File a Motion to Intervene and a Motion for Grandparent‚Äôs Rights. Include the case number from the original case in your motion. Your motion must explain in detail why you have a serious link with the child. It should also outline why it‚Äôs in the child‚Äôs best interest (beyond ‚Äúit‚Äôs good for kids to see their grandparents‚Äù).
	
	
	If there is no case on file: You will have to file a Petition with the court where the grandchild lives. This can get complex and will almost always need an attorney‚Äôs help.
	


In most cases, you will need to have a trial and prove the issues above. You can‚Äôt really predict how much time you will get to see the child. A good rule is that the greater the relationship the more time you will be given.

&nbsp;


I have defacto custody of my grandchild, and so what do I need to do to set up legal rights so that I can do things a parent would normally do?

There are several options for grandparents to get the legal power over their grandchildren. The question becomes which is better. The article does a better job of explaining the pros and cons of each option.

The options are: 1) Power of attorney, 2) Foster care or kinship care, 3) Legal guardianship/ Permanent guardianship, and, 4) Adoption.

&nbsp;

Power of Attorney:


	This is the easiest to get if the child was freely left with you. It makes a good short-term solution.



	You need a certified statement from the parent(s) as to what you are allowed to consent to or have access to.



	The grandparent should keep the original signed document. Then make copies to give to the relevant agencies (school, kid‚Äôs doctors, etc.)



	Some agencies may need an original, in which case the parent(s) should sign more than one original document. The grandparent should still keep one of the originals.


&nbsp;

Foster Care or Kinship Care:


	When the state has become involved and there is some sort of juvenile proceeding (CINC-Child In Need of Care cases) and the grandparent or other relative is the foster home placement.



	The court will issue specific orders. Those orders can be used by the grandparent to get done legally whatever needs to be done. As long as you confer well with the court and social workers, then you should be taken care of.



	If your grandchild is involved in such a proceeding and you want to get involved: You can ask the court to appoint you an attorney at no cost. If your income is too high, then you may have to hire an attorney.



	Keep in mind that when the grandparent is providing foster care, they should be receiving child support of some kind for the grandchild.


&nbsp;

‚ÄãLegal Guardianship/Permanent Guardianship:


	
	This is a more long-term fix. It has the bonus of not stripping the parent by design of all their rights. This can be done in a CINC case or freely between a grandchild‚Äôs parent(s) and the grandparent. It can also sometimes happen without the consent of the parent(s).
	



	
	Here, the grandparent becomes the ‚Äúlegal guardian‚Äù of the child and becomes in charge of their care and control. The grandparent would be overseen by the court. They would have to, from time to time, appear in court to give reports about the status of the child. When the condition that caused the need for the custody is resolved, and the parent is ready to resume their duties, then it simply ends.
	



	
	‚ÄãIt can be a permanent solution where the grandparent only wants to assume duties until the child turns 18. There are some issues with insurance companies that may arise. Also, if the grandparent dies while the child is in their care, the child does not have any legal right to inherit or collect social security survivor‚Äôs benefits.
	



	
	Guardianships can be expensive to set up, depending on what your local attorneys charge.
	


&nbsp;

Adoption:


	This is the most extreme option! Make sure you understand the consequences of adoption before deciding to pursue it.



	For a grandparent to adopt, the parent must give up their rights to the child. If they don‚Äôt give up their right, then the grandparent has to prove parental unfitness. The grandparent must then ask for the parent‚Äôs rights to be ended.‚Äã



	This means that the parents will no longer have any duty to the child. The parents will no longer have a say in the child‚Äôs upbringing. They would also have no duty to pay for the child any longer. The adoptive parents (the grandparents) would legally have to do all things for the child. This includes supporting them money-wise.



	The child would then be able to inherit from the adoptive parents. They could also receive social security survivor‚Äôs benefits, if under 18, when the grandparent dies.

&nbsp;

WARNINGS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are basic forms that will not cover every situation. A divorce can be complicated and using legal forms without a lawyer‚Äôs help can harm your legal rights.&nbsp; Every district court has specific local rules that apply and you must follow those rules or you may not be able to finish your case.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Clerk of the District Court cannot help you prepare these forms.&nbsp; The Clerk cannot give legal advice about your rights or responsibilities and can only provide very limited information about the divorce process.&nbsp; If you have any questions, you should contact a lawyer. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to note that property decisions are binding and may not be subject to modification.&nbsp; In addition, agreements regarding debt are NOT binding on, and do not affect the rights of, third parties.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

Facts About Filing for Divorce in Kansas:


	You or your spouse must have lived in Kansas for at least sixty (60) days before filing a Petition for Divorce with the court.
	You must start the legal process by filing certain documents, and paying a filing fee, with the Clerk of the District Court in the county where you or your spouse lives.
	Once your case is filed, you will be given a case number which must be on all documents you file with the court in the future.
	If you are filing for a divorce without the assistance of a lawyer, you are responsible for completing all the necessary forms and the Clerk of the District Court cannot help you prepare any legal documents or provide any legal advice.
	Once you have filed your Petition for Divorce, it is important that you inform the Clerk of the District Court if you or your spouse‚Äôs address changes.
	Terminology:


¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filing Spouse = Petitioner or Plaintiff

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-filing Spouse = Respondent or Defendant

&nbsp;

Instructions for filing a divorce:

&nbsp;

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete the Civil Information Sheet, Domestic Relations Affidavit, Parenting Plan and Petition for Divorce.

&nbsp;

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign the Petition for Divorce and the Domestic Relations Affidavit in front of a notary public.&nbsp; Notary publics may commonly be found in law firms, title companies and financial institutions, i.e. banks and credit unions.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File with the Clerk of the District Court:

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original Petition for Divorce with required copies;

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original Domestic Relations Affidavit with required copies;&nbsp;

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original Civil Information Sheet; and

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Request for Service Form, if not filing a Voluntary Entry of Appearance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay the required filing fee.&nbsp; (Check with the Clerk or the local rules to determine the number &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of additional copies required as well as the amount of the filing fee.)

&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must notify your spouse that you have filed a Petition for Divorce in one of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following ways:

&nbsp;

a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚ÄúVoluntary Entry of Appearance‚Äù: Your spouse signs a Voluntary Entry of Appearance form in front of a notary public, which acknowledges receipt of the Petition for Divorce.&nbsp; The Voluntary Entry of Appearance with your spouse‚Äôs original signature is then filed with the Clerk.

&nbsp;

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚ÄúSheriff‚Äôs Service‚Äù: You must fill out a Request for Service Form, requesting that the sheriff deliver the Petition for Divorce to your spouse.&nbsp; If your spouse lives in Kansas, you must pay a sheriff‚Äôs service fee.&nbsp; If your spouse lives in a State other than Kansas, it is your responsibility to find out the procedures required by the sheriff in that state and county and to pay any fees required.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your spouse lives in Kansas, please complete the In State Summons form.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your spouse lives in a state other than Kansas, please complete the Out of State Summons form.

&nbsp;

c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚ÄúCertified Mail Service‚Äù: You must mail the summons and Petition for Divorce by certified mail - return receipt requested to your spouse at his or her last known residential address.&nbsp; File the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù ‚Äúreturn-receipt card‚Äù with the Clerk when you receive it from the US Postal Service.

&nbsp;

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact the Clerk of the District Court to find out how to get a final hearing date and time in your divorce. Different courts have different procedures and requirements. Kansas law provides that a divorce decree cannot be entered until at least 60 days after the petition filing date.

&nbsp;

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send written notice of the hearing date to your spouse and file the original of that notice with the Clerk. Certified mail is the preferred method of mailing.

&nbsp;

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If required by local rules, attend and complete any required parenting, co-parenting, divorce or other required classes prior to your final divorce hearing.

&nbsp;

8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete the Child Support Worksheet (CSW).&nbsp; Instructions for completion of the CSW may be found on the Kansas Judicial Branch website at http://www.kscourts.org/rules-procedures-forms/Child-Support-Guidelines/default.asp, or by visiting your local law library.&nbsp; The CSW must be completed prior to your hearing.

&nbsp;

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may complete paragraphs 8, 12-13, 20-23, and 25 of the Decree of Divorce before the final divorce hearing.&nbsp; The remaining paragraphs of the Decree of Divorce are for the judge to complete.

&nbsp;

10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attend the final divorce hearing, taking with you:

a.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Decree of Divorce and at least 3 copies;

b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any written property division agreement signed by you and your spouse;

c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Written proof that you gave to your spouse notice of the hearing date and time;

d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Required copies of the completed Domestic Relations Affidavit;

e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Required copies of the completed Parenting Plan;

f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required copies of the completed Child Support Worksheet;

g.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kansas Payment Center Information Sheet (for child support); and,

h.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vital Statistics Form.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you present the decree to the judge, you should be prepared to tell the judge about the facts stated in the petition, that you and your spouse are incompatible, and why your proposed agreements are fair.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the original and 3 copies of the decree of divorce to the divorce hearing.&nbsp; Once the judge has signed the original decree, take the original and all copies to the Clerk who will file the original.&nbsp; Provide your former spouse a file stamped copy of the decree and keep the remaining copies.

It is illegal for anyone who is not licensed to practice law in Kansas to: (A) give another person advice about that other person‚Äôs legal rights or duties; (B) help another person to select, draft, or complete any legal document that affects the other person‚Äôs rights or duties; (C) represent another person in court; and (D) help another person negotiate legal rights or responsibilities. If you paid a company for these forms, contact the Attorney General‚Äôs consumer complaint hotline and the Kansas Judicial Council.  4. Courts require anyone filing a divorce case to follow court rules. You must follow the court rules or you will not be able to finish your case. Self-represented persons are expected to know the rules as if you were an attorney.  5. IF YOUR SPOUSE IS ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY, YOU SHOULD CONSULT AN ATTORNEY BECAUSE YOU MUST MEET SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.  6. It is important to note that property decisions are binding and may not be subject to modification. In addition, agreements regarding debt are NOT binding on, and do not affect the rights of, third parties.  7. If one spouse is to receive part of the other spouse‚Äôs retirement, additional documents may be needed to complete the transfer. You will need to seek the advice of an attorney to complete this process because it is outside the scope of these pro se forms.  Facts About Filing for Divorce in Kansas:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You or your spouse must have lived in Kansas for at least sixty (60) days before a Petition for Divorce may be filed with the court.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal divorce process is started by filing certain documents with the Clerk of the District Court in the county where you or your spouse lives.&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Your divorce case has a case number which must be on all documents you file with the court in the future.  &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ If you are proceeding with a divorce without the assistance of an attorney, you are responsible for completing all the necessary forms and the Clerk of the District Court cannot help you prepare any legal documents or provide any legal advice.  &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Once you have filed your Answer, it is important that you inform the Clerk of the District Court if you or your spouse‚Äôs address changes.  &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Terminology:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filing Spouse = Petitioner  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-filing Spouse = Respondent  &nbsp; Instructions for responding to a divorce action:  &nbsp; 1. You have the right to file an Answer to a Petition for Divorce but you are not required to do so. If you are on active military duty you should not file an Answer before seeking the advice of an attorney.  &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. If you choose to respond to the Petition for Divorce, complete the Answer, Domestic Relations Affidavit and a Parenting Plan if you disagree with the filing spouse‚Äôs parenting plan.  &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Sign the Answer and the Domestic Relations Affidavit in front of a notary public. Notary publics may commonly be found in law firms, title companies and financial institutions, i.e. banks and credit unions.  &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. File with the Clerk of the District Court:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original Answer with required copies;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original Domestic Relations Affidavit with required copies; and  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Voluntary Entry of Appearance, if not already filed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (Check with the Clerk or the local rules to determine the number of additional copies required.)  &nbsp; 5. Complete the Child Support Worksheet (CSW).

You‚Äôve Decided to Get Divorced. Now What?


	Educate yourself on divorce issues and procedures in Kansas.
	Consult with an attorney.
	Prepare your paperwork and gather all necessary documents.


Jurisdiction Issues: Where to File?

For Kansas Courts to have jurisdiction over you: you must have lived in Kansas 60 days before filing.

To have jurisdiction over your spouse:


	He/she either has to have lived in Kansas; or, if they have moved out of state, they must have lived in Kansas and you must have separated from each other while he/she still lived here.



	If your spouse has not resided in Kansas, he or she must agree to submit to Kansas for the issues of child support, asset division, and debt division. &nbsp;


If you want the Court to issue Orders regarding the residence and custody of your minor children:


	The children must have lived in Kansas for 6 months prior to filing for divorce.
	If the parties and the children have resided in Kansas less than 6 months:
	
		Both spouses must have moved from their home state to Kansas and separated in Kansas.
	
	


The divorce must be filed in the County where one party resides or where the Respondent can be served.

Gather All Necessary Information and Documents

Below is a list of documents and information you will need to gather and keep in a safe place:


	Have contact information for both you and the other party. This includes family members and employers.
	Social Security numbers of all the parties, including the children.
	Date of births of all the parties, including the children.
	State of birth of all the parties, including the children.
	Necessary documentation:
	
		Credit reports for you and your spouse. (Each person can pull one credit report per year at&nbsp;a.www.annualcreditreport.com).
		Copy of credit card statements&nbsp;(at least the last three months, including transactions). If you don‚Äôt have a copy, most credit card companies will allow you to print off up to twelve months of reports from their websites.
		Bank account information, including transaction reports.
		Current pay stubs for both parties.
		At least last year's tax returns. If you don't have these you can request a copy from the IRS.&nbsp;
	
	
	List of assets:
	
		Real&nbsp;Estate (legal descriptions of all property owned by you and your spouse, or each of you individually, or with other parties).
		Cars
		Bank accounts
		Retirement accounts
	
	
	List of all monthly expenses (and copies of debts)
	
		monthly household expenses
		Rent
		Utility
		Phone
		Cell phone
		Cable
		School expenses
		Insurance
		Medical expenses
		Food
	
	


**Once you have gathered the above information, keep it in a safe place. You will need to be able to retrieve the documents even if you are Court Ordered out of the marital house. **

Pre-Planning

Things to consider and prepare before you get started:

1.Finances


	Set aside money for when you leave.
	Divide debts (decide what you are going to pay and what your spouse is going to pay)
	Divide bank accounts. Consider closing joint accounts.&nbsp; At the very least, set up an account in your name only and make sure there are funds in that account.
	Decide where you are going to live.
	
		If you are going to remain in the marital home, plan to make the house payment or rent payment on your own.
		If you vacate the residence, take all necessary documents and important personal property with you when you leave. Don‚Äôt depend on your spouse making them available to you after you move.
	
	
	Create a budget for paying your bills.


2.Plan on initially paying your bills without support from your spouse.


	Make a budget as if you will receive no help from the other party. This will make sure you are not surprised and are able to take care of yourself if need be.


3.When the divorce is filed, a Restraining Order will be entered


	This Order will prevent you and your spouse from selling or transferring assets.
	Also, it prevents either party from canceling insurance and changing beneficiaries on retirement and insurance plans until after the divorce has been finalized.


4.Typically, at the end of your divorce, the Court will consider both debts and assets and divide&nbsp;everything 50/50.


	Don‚Äôt be greedy and take more than your 50% of the assets when you leave.
	On the other hand don‚Äôt assume you‚Äôll be responsible for nothing and your spouse will be responsible for all the marital debt.


5.Moving out of the house


	You will need to decide whether you or your spouse will be vacating the marital residence (home).
	It is best if the children do not leave their current school.
	You should not move out of state without the Court‚Äôs permission.


Plan for Children

1. Keep a log of who provides their daily care, attends school events, and doctor‚Äôs appointments.

2. Create a schedule for the children to be with both parents.


	Keep in mind both parents‚Äô work schedules and the children‚Äôs school schedules


3.&nbsp;If you want residential custody, then it is best to maintain a work schedule that allows you to&nbsp;have as much time with your children as possible.


	Working third shift makes it difficult for you to be there to meet your children‚Äôs needs.


4.&nbsp;If custody becomes a contested issue, you will be living under a microscope&nbsp;‚Üí&nbsp;You have to monitor who enters your life; and, most importantly, your kids‚Äô lives.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Strongly consider waiting to introduce a new girlfriend or boyfriend to the children.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Know your new boyfriend or girlfriend‚Äôs background. His or her problems become your problems in a divorce.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c. Be careful of the information and pictures you place on Facebook or other social network sites.


	Pictures of you and new significant others are inappropriate
	Pictures of you inappropriately dressed, nude, drinking, or partying should never be placed on the internet
	Also, ask your friends to watch what pictures they add to Facebook or what they tag


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d. Carefully consider anything you put in writing, this includes email and texting. Anything negative, angry, or spiteful you say will come back to haunt you in Court.

5.&nbsp;Spend as much time as possible with your children--both for their adjustment and to&nbsp;demonstrate to the Court you are a responsible parent

6.&nbsp;Communicate with your soon to be ex-husband or ex-wife.


	Just because you want your spouse out of your life, does not mean it is in your children‚Äôs best interest that their other parent is out of their lives.
	Communicate important information regarding school and medical needs.
	Don‚Äôt make unilateral decisions. Consult the other parent about such things as school and medical needs of the children


7. Remember the divorce is between you and your spouse--not your spouse and the children.


	No matter how bad your relationship is with the other parent, the children did not want this divorce. They are feeling grief and loss.
	You may consider entering them in counseling.


8.&nbsp;Watch what you say in the presence of the children: ‚Äúlittle pictures have big ears.‚Äù


	The children will overhear even what you say to others. They will digest it, retain it, and spit it out at the wrong time.
	Further, don‚Äôt try to undermine the children‚Äôs relationship with the other party. &nbsp;In most cases, even a bad parent is better than no parent.


9. Supervised parenting time is appropriate when the other parent has a drug or alcohol problem,&nbsp;has physically endangered the minor children, or is mentally unstable.


	The fact they have a new girlfriend or boyfriend is not a justification for supervised parenting time.
	Further, the fact that you do not like his or her new roommates or housing situation is not a good reason for supervised parenting time.
	Parenting time can be structured so that there is no overnight.


10.&nbsp;If you feel supervised parenting time is appropriate, have a plan.


	Have in mind a person who you and your spouse will agree upon to provide supervision.
	If you do not have a responsible person, the Courts will provide supervision at a neutral site for a cost.


Emotional Support


	Consider counseling.
	Always consider the children‚Äôs needs and their best interests.
	Consider contacting a safe house or domestic violence program for counseling if domestic violence has been a part of the relationship.


Domestic Violence

If there has been domestic violence in the relationship, have a record of:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


	Dates and circumstances of incidents
	Names and contact information for any witnesses
	Incident&nbsp;&nbsp;and police report numbers


Also, consider the following advice going forward:


	Think about meeting the other party at a neutral site to exchange the children, usually either the police department or QuikTrip.
	Do not let the other party return to the residence for any reason. Change codes and locks if necessary.
	Call the police if any further incidents of abuse occur.
	Have a plan in place in the event of any future abuse and a place to go.


Privacy Challenges and Safety


	When leaving a relationship it is important to think about whether or not it is necessary to change important pass codes and/or numbers that may allow the other party to track your whereabouts, activities, and/or perform personal and financial sabotage. &nbsp;


Consider if the following secure numbers need to be changed in your individual situation:


	Cell phone passwords/codes to retrieve your phone messages.
	Banking/Debit card PIN numbers
	Food Stamp Debt Card ID number
	Direct Deposit information (Bills and/or paycheck)
	Security codes of housing/apartments
	Mailing Address
	Address on Court Papers
	Personal Phone Numbers
	E-mail passwords
	Myspace/Facebook passwords


Behavior- How to Act?

In Court:


	Dress appropriately: no shorts, no miniskirts, no t-shirts with sayings, no club-wear or sleep-wear, no baseball caps, no belly shirts, etc.
	Watch your body language: eye-rolling, gestures, flipping people off, etc.
	Show respect: for the Court, opposing attorney, and the other party
	
		This extends to outside of Court. Don‚Äôt place bumper stickers on your car insulting the other party or messages or posts on your Facebook page.
	
	


Treat the Judge and Limited Case Manager with respect.


	Act as if they control your life--because they do.
	Even if you don‚Äôt agree with their decision, show respect and don‚Äôt argue.
	The Court will judge you on how you behave as much as what you say.
	This includes conversations outside of Court.


Conclusion


	Share all information with your lawyer, whether you feel it is positive or negative, preferably before the other side shares this information.
	
		This includes reports of bad behavior and potentially embarrassing actions.
	
	
	Follow your attorney‚Äôs advice. &nbsp;
	
		This may be your first time through the system; it may be your attorney‚Äôs one thousandth time.
		An attorney is also a counselor. Listen to what they say, evaluate it, and consider following that hard-earned advice.

DEFINITIONS OF COMMON LEGAL TERMS

Child Custody is divided into legal custody and residency.


	Legal custody: Not who the child lives with; but, rather, who makes decisions regarding the children, such as medical and schooling.
	Residency: Person selected with the right to decide where the children live.


Types of Legal Custody

Joint Legal Custody 


	Both parties should consult each other regarding major decisions for the children.
	This includes, but is not limited to: where the children go to school; where they go to church; who their doctors are; if they should be allowed to get piercings, tattoos, etc.; consent to marriage; whether braces are appropriate; whether therapy should be sought; and whether the child should receive certain medications.
	Both parents have equal access to medical and school records.
	Joint Legal Custody is the preferred method of custody in Kansas. It has nothing to do with who the children live with or the amount of time each party spends with the children.


Sole Legal Custody 


	The residential parent does not have to consult with the other parent regarding major decisions for the children.
	Both parents have equal access to medical and school records.
	It does not give the residential parent the right to move the children without notice to the other parent. The parent still must comply with the law and provide 30 day notice prior to moving.
	This does not prevent or limit the other party‚Äôs parenting time with the children.
	The Judge must make the finding that there are facts to support the awarding of sole legal custody.


Full Custody - There is no such thing as ‚Äúfull custody‚Äù in Kansas.

Types of Residency

Shared Residential Custody - Each parent spends 50% of the time with the children.

Primary Residential Custody


	One parent is chosen for the children to live with the majority of the time.
	The other party may be granted parenting time.


Divided Residential Custody - Each party has one or more of the children living mainly with them.

Types of Cases

Divorce ‚Äì A divorce terminates a ceremonial or common law marriage. Marriage is a voidable contract and the divorce cancels that contract.

Annulment ‚Äì An annulment erases a marriage, as if it did not happen. &nbsp;


	There must be a material mistake of fact or the marriage had to be void due to lack of capacity to be married (i.e., your spouse was only 17 years old at the time of marriage, or your spouse was already married to someone else).


Legal Separation ‚Äì A legal separation can be filed.


	The parties are still married upon completion.
	Debts and assets are divided; custody, parenting time, and child support can be ordered. &nbsp;
	The marriage can be terminated at a later date.


Alternative Dispute Resolution

Judges are happiest when the parties work out their issues themselves. In order to promote this, the Court may turn to different forms of dispute resolution, known as ADR, such as:

Mediation ‚Äì The parties sit down with a neutral third party who tries to help the parties reach an agreement regarding parenting time and custody of the minor children.


	It is non-binding and anything that occurs or is said in mediation is confidential.


Limited Case Management - Process where the parties meet with a trained third party who, upon interviewing the parties, looking at evidence, and interviewing witnesses, makes recommendations to the Court on who the children should live with and the other parties‚Äô parenting time based on statutory factors.

Types of Service

A party must be ‚Äúserved‚Äù a copy of the initial pleadings through an official source. &nbsp;


	This means that the party must be given a copy of the legal papers.
	A party cannot give the papers to the other party and have that consider proper service by the Courts. &nbsp;
	A person must be ‚Äúofficially given‚Äù a set of the papers in order for the Courts to divide property, debts and order child support.


1.Sheriff-&nbsp;A Sheriff Deputy delivers copies of the papers to the other party where they work or live.


	Cost&nbsp;is $5.00 within Kansas or up to $100.00 out of State.


2. Voluntary Entry of Appearance- A form signed by the other party and notarized.


	It does not mean that they agree with the papers but it alleviates the need to have the Sheriff deliver the papers to them


3.&nbsp;Special process server- Either a friend or family member who is considered to be of ‚Äúgood‚Äù character who agrees to deliver the papers to the other party.


	They must be appointed by the Court and complete documents swearing that they delivered the papers to the other parties.
	There are also people who will serve papers for a fee


4. Certified Mail- This is not the same as regular mail.

5. Publication- If you do not know how to locate the other party, you can serve them by publication.


	However, you cannot divide debts or receive child support
	There are specific newspapers that the courts allow for publication notice and a cost attached. Check with the clerk of the court.


Parties to a case

Petitioner ‚Äì The person who files the papers, starts the action.

Respondent ‚Äì The person who is served the papers.


	There is no long-term advantage between being the Petitioner or Respondent.
	The parties will always remain the same, even in post-judgment actions.
	
		Once the Petitioner, always the Petitioner. &nbsp;Once the Respondent, always the Respondent.
	
	


Child Support

Child Support is payment from one parent to the other parent for support of the minor children.


	Child Support may be ordered whether the parties exercise shared residential custody or primary residential custody.&nbsp;
	It is calculated through a formula created by the Kansas Supreme Court. &nbsp;
	
		It is based on the income of the parties, the number of children of the parties, other children that the paying party may be financially responsible for, daycare expenses, and health care expenses.
		The tables are located at&nbsp; www.kscourts.org. There is a child support calculator at www.kansaslegalservices.org.
	
	


Spousal Maintenance

Spousal Maintenance (also known as alimony) is payment made from one spouse for the care of the other spouse.


	It is not a guarantee just because you have been married.
	Spousal Support is generally based on the concept that one party has a need and the other party has the ability to pay. If incomes are equal then it probably won‚Äôt be ordered.
	It is generally not ordered in short-term marriages.


Marital Assets

Marital assets are property accumulated during the marriage.


	This includes houses, cars, RV‚Äôs, collections or personal items, refrigerators, bank accounts, retirement accounts, inheritance, or lawsuits.
	It can be any type of property with value. &nbsp;
	You must have an ownership interest in the property, i.e., your name or your spouse‚Äôs name is on the title.


Marital Debt

Marital debt is any bill that occurred during the marriage. &nbsp;


	It does not matter if it is just in your name, just in your spouse‚Äôs name, or in both names.
	If either party accrues debt during the marriage, it is a marital debt. This includes loans, credit cards, medical bills, etc.


Equity

Equity is used to figure the value of houses, trailers, cars, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;


	It is the amount something is worth minus what you owe.
	
		For example, if you could sell your house for $100,000, but you owe $80,000, your equity is $20,000 ($100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000).
	
	
	You can get a value either by hiring an appraiser or looking at the tax statement (tax value is usually a little less than what an appraiser will value your house).


Venue

A divorce can only be filed in the County where the parties reside or where the Respondent lives or works.

Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction means the Judge can tell you what to do. The court needs jurisdiction over the people (personal jurisdiction) and the subject matter.

Subject Matter

Means the Judge can divide your stuff and divorce you.

Best Interest

When determining placement or custody of the minor children, the Court generally looks at the children‚Äôs best interest, not the parent‚Äôs wishes.


	The Court studies several factors and considers the child‚Äôs best interests to be whatever promotes the children‚Äôs physical and mental health and safety.


Home State

This is the state where the children have resided for the 6 months prior to the filing of a case.


	Generally, Kansas must be the children‚Äôs home state prior to a Judge granting either party residency or custody.
	There are exceptions to this rule.

FAQ on Paternity, Wrong Father‚Äôs Name on the Birth Certificate

Question: I signed the birth certificate of a child thinking she was mine.&nbsp; I have since learned that the child is not mine. The mother has filed for child support and I had papers served on me. Is there anything I can do to get my name taken off the birth certificate? What should I do now? &nbsp;

A review of Kansas law related to paternity is here: &nbsp;&nbsp;http://paternity.uslegal.com/paternity-laws/kansas-paternity-law/&nbsp;

If the man on the birth certificate has been served with child support papers, this is his only chance to seek a DNA test to determine if the child is his or not. &nbsp; At this point, there is a legal presumption that it is his child, because he has voluntarily placed his name is on the birth certificate. &nbsp;In a legal sense, he has ‚Äúadopted‚Äù this child by placing his name on the birth certificate, whether it is his child or not.

He needs to respond to the Petition he received. Of course, getting an attorney is the easiest and best way to do that. &nbsp;If he is unable to hire an attorney and needs to represent himself, here are some tips: &nbsp;If there is an option for showing up in court, he should do that and verbally deny the part of the petition saying he is the father. He should ask for a trial and for a DNA paternity test. &nbsp;It is safest to do a written denial answer to the Petition. &nbsp;A sample answer is here.&nbsp; It will just give the format for the answer. &nbsp;He will need to type the answer out. &nbsp;There are deadlines for filing this answer that are set out in the Summons. &nbsp;Usually, it is 20 days after the date of service of the summons. &nbsp;This is an important deadline and must be followed.&nbsp;

In addition, it will matter what type of relationship/contact the man on the birth certificate has had with the child. &nbsp;This will be determined at a ‚ÄúRoss Hearing‚Äù. &nbsp;The thought behind this part of the process is not to take away, due to biology, someone that the child has thought of as their father over a period of time. &nbsp;An attorney may be appointed for the child, to speak to the child‚Äôs interest in all this. &nbsp;The younger the child, the easier to get past this hurdle for a man who is listed on the birth certificate only.

Assuming those things are met, the mother, child and man on the birth certificate are ordered for a DNA test. &nbsp;If SRS is bringing the paternity case, they usually pay for the test. &nbsp;If the man on the birth certificate is the father, he is ordered to repay SRS the cost of the test. &nbsp;These tests cost about $150 per person, so $450 total. &nbsp;Some courts make the man on the birth certificate pay for at least their test up front, so he should be prepared for that possibility.&nbsp;

The DNA test comes back in percentages. &nbsp;Sometimes, the test totally exclude someone as the father. &nbsp;The test can show a percent likelihood that the man is the father. &nbsp;The Court will make a legal finding that a man is not the father, if the percent is chance he is the father is low. The man on the birth certificate has the burden of proof to show he is not the father.&nbsp; The man will be found to be the father, based on substantial evidence, if the DNA test shows a strong percentage chance he is the father.&nbsp; It doesn‚Äôt have to be 100%. &nbsp;While the Court is makes a finding that he is not the father, the man should ask the &nbsp;Judge to order the Department of Vital Statistics to remove his name from the birth certificate.&nbsp;

KLS Documents",Child support worksheet,Family Law,"&nbsp;All Kansas Judges use the Kansas&nbsp;Child Support&nbsp;guidelines to figure the Child Support paid.&nbsp;

It is the duty of the parties to bring a worksheet prepared following those rules to Court at the time of the final divorce hearing.

&nbsp;

Check out our&nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions&nbsp;about&nbsp;interactive interviews.&nbsp;


	This&nbsp;interactive interview&nbsp;is aimed to get your info and create a worksheet based on these rules.
	You will need to have facts ready for the interactive interview if you want to complete the interview without pause.&nbsp;


‚ñ∫&nbsp;A link is provided at the end of the page to the interview.&nbsp;The interview is for cases where the joint income of both parents is less than $50,000.




What will I need to complete the&nbsp;Child Support&nbsp;Worksheet?

During this interview you will need to know:

1. The income of both parents.&nbsp;


	You should know your own income, based on hourly pay or monthly income.&nbsp;
	
		You should be ready to deliver a pay stub to support the amount you put in this interview.&nbsp;
	
	
	You can guess the income of the other parent if you don‚Äôt have specific data.&nbsp;


2. The costs of&nbsp;health insurance&nbsp;given by either parent.&nbsp;


	If other adults or children are included in the health insurance, you will need to define the part of the cost that goes for these children.&nbsp;
	
		That may mean finding out the cost of the insurance without these children, and taking that away from the cost that is in fact paid.&nbsp;
		Keep records of this totaling.
	
	


3. The costs of work related child care for these children.&nbsp;


	If each parent pays a part of the child care, you need actual or estimates of the cost paid by the other parent.&nbsp;
	
		Remember summer costs as well as costs during the school year.&nbsp;
	
	
	You may need to figure the cost for an entire year, then divide by 12 to get a monthly mean.&nbsp;
	You should keep copies of the papers upon which you base your cost.


4. Custody Plan.

You will also need to know what the&nbsp;care plan&nbsp;is between the parents.&nbsp; You will be asked the amount of time that each parent spends with the child.&nbsp;


	You may need to calculate the percent of time the child/ren are with each parent.&nbsp; You can do this in the following way.
	
		Start with 168 hours during each week.&nbsp; This is because the school or day care hours are not taken into account.
		Subtract the hours in school or day care.
		Track the number of other hours that the child/ren are with each parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
	
	One way to do this is to make a chart showing each hour of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a column for each day of the week.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		If the parenting time schedule is different from week to week, include as many weeks are you need, to get a repeating schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Mark the number of hours the child is with each parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
	
	Count the total hours and the hours for each parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		The mother‚Äôs share is her hours/total hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The father‚Äôs share is his hours/total hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This gives you a percent of time with each parent, which is needed for figuring&nbsp;child support.
	
	
	If the parent‚Äôs share the time evenly (each has 50% of the time) then you do not need to do the math above. &nbsp;



If you want some estimates of the ratios, rather than completing the additions above, here are some estimates:&nbsp;

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãIf the non-residential parent has less than 39 hours a week, it is less than 35% and no further calculation is needed.

If the non-residential parent has about 45 hours a week, that is 40%.&nbsp; (Note: A Friday night to Sunday night schedule, each week, would be about 45 hours a week.&nbsp; But, an rotating every other weekend schedule would be about 22% time. )

If the non-residential parent has about 50 hours a week, that is about 45% of the time.&nbsp;



	These percentages are estimates because the amount of time varies with the hours spent in child care or school.&nbsp;
	These estimates are based on a plan where the child/ren spend 40 hours a week in school or day care.


What about shared custody or other options?

Even when the parent‚Äôs agree to share the time with the child on an equal basis, the child support guidelines may set child support to be paid by one parent to the other.&nbsp;


	There is a method for defining support in a shared custody plan.&nbsp;


This would need the parent to have a written agreement for meeting the direct expenses of the child/ren.&nbsp;


	On a regular basis, the parents would trade receipts for things like clothing, school expenses, sports fees, etc.&nbsp;
	
		One parent would pay an amount to even up the amount paid.
	
	


Parents using this plan have to have a written agreement outlining how they will deal with these expenses.&nbsp;


	The child support is then aimed to meet the housing, child care, insurance and food needs of the child/ren and deal with an earnings gap between the parents.


If the parents do not have a written plan for dealing with expenses in a shared custody deal, there is a process for settling child support.&nbsp;


	You will be asked if the parenting time is equal and if you have a written plan.&nbsp;
	If you answer that there is not a written plan, then one parent will be in charge of all the direct expenses of the child.&nbsp;
	The interview will ask which parent is responsible.&nbsp; Then the interview will decide what amount of child support is due to that parent on an Equal Parenting Time worksheet.


Why do I need to compute the % of time the child is with each parent?&nbsp;

The Child Support guidelines allow a change of child support for a parent who has the child/ren more than 35% of the time.&nbsp;


	This adjustment varies with the amount of time the child spends with the non-residential parent, if the amount of time is more than 35% of the time.&nbsp;
	The amount of time with the non-custodial parent must be more than 39 hours a week to qualify for the adjustment.


What if we don‚Äôt agree about child support?

Sometimes, the parties don‚Äôt agree about the factors that go in the guidelines.&nbsp;


	In that event, each party would prepare their own worksheet based on the factors they believe should be included.&nbsp;
	The Judge can then gauge both worksheets and make a decision about what should be included.


Can I prepare more than one worksheet from one interview?

Because of the programming that goes on behind the scenes in the interview, some choices don‚Äôt reset if you start over.&nbsp;


	If you want to do a different interview with totally different theories about custody plans, for instance, please start over and do a new interview, entering your data again.


Who can‚Äôt use this program successfully?


	If the joined income of the parents is&nbsp;more than $50,000,&nbsp;then this program won‚Äôt work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	When parents have had other children since the first child support order, they may be eligible for a multiple family adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		This program does not automatically calculate those adjustments.&nbsp;
	
	
	When the parent paying child support&nbsp;lives in another state,&nbsp;they may qualify for an Interstate Pay Differential Adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		This program does not calculate that adjustment.
	
	
	For&nbsp;parents who are not swapping (every other year) which parent claims&nbsp;the dependent deduction on Federal Income Tax returns,&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;variation on child support.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		This program doesn‚Äôt calculate that adjustment.&nbsp;
	
	


‚ñ∫ &nbsp;Parents with one of these conditions are urged to consider other options, including:


	Prepare their own child support worksheet&nbsp;from&nbsp;www.childsupporttools.com&nbsp;(The cost is currently $19.95 for single family ‚Äì multiple uses for up to 30 days.)
	Review the child support guidelines&nbsp;at&nbsp;http://www.kscourts.org/Rules-procedures-forms/Child-support-guidelines/2012-guidelines.asp&nbsp;and prepare a child support worksheet.&nbsp;
	Seek help from an attorney&nbsp;who will provide limited scope representation, allowing you to select the services you wish from an attorney, paying for only those services you select and completing the other needed tasks yourself.&nbsp;
	
		You may find an attorney who offers this type of legal services from the Kansas Bar Association Lawyer&nbsp;Referral Service at 1-800-928-3111

NEW &nbsp;How do I get child support to stop?

If you are currently under a child support order, but believe that you shouldn‚Äôt be paying child support, you need to get the child support order modified.&nbsp; If the reason you believe child support should stop is a change in the parenting time (custody) of the child, then that order must be changed, also.&nbsp;

You can use this form, Motion to Modify Child Support, to change or stop the child support order.&nbsp;

You can use the Motion to Modfiy Parenting Time form to change the custody/parenting time order to match the current situation. Here are the&nbsp;Instructions for the Motion to Modify Parenting Time&nbsp;form. &nbsp;

You should do this soon after the circumstances change, since it is not possible to go back in time and reset the child support due.&nbsp;

Another reason for child support to stop is the age of the child.&nbsp;


	If one child has turned 18 (and it is July of the year the child finished high school), but there are other children under 18, there is an automatic reduction in the amount of support, based on the % reduction in the number of children.&nbsp; If there were three children and now the support is for only two children, the amount of support due is automatically reduced by one-third.&nbsp; You can complete a child support worksheet and see if support should be reduced by more than that.&nbsp; If so, you should file a motion for a modification of the child support.&nbsp; The number and age of the children are factors in determining the amount of support.&nbsp;
	If all children are 18 and it is July of the year that child finished high school, you should investigate why an income withholding order hasn‚Äôt been stopped.&nbsp; If there is unpaid support from the past, the order can stay in place until all support is due.&nbsp; You will have to do some calculations to determine that.&nbsp;&nbsp;


NEW &nbsp;Can the retirement monies of noncustodial parent way behind in child support be garnished?

Generally, retirement funds held in an IRA or employer retirement account are not available for attachment.&nbsp;

NEW &nbsp;It would be nice if we could get info on how to find out what you owe in back support.&nbsp; I wanted to learn more about Child Support payments in arrears.

There is not a simple way to answer this question.&nbsp; You can contact the Kansas Child Support Services during regular business days toll free at 1-888-757-2445 (TTY 1-888-688-1666, for the hearing impaired).&nbsp;They can provide some information to you.&nbsp; However, if you don‚Äôt agree with the answers, you can use these questions to come up with the amount of arrears:

1) What month was child support first ordered?&nbsp; What amount?

&nbsp; Multiply the dollar amount by the number of months since the initial order.

2) Have any changes been made in the amount of child support?&nbsp; Use this to modify your calculation.

3) Determine the amount of all payments made.&nbsp; A complete list should be linked to the county and case number and found at http://www.kspaycenter.com/.

4)&nbsp; If you are aware of tax refunds intercepted or other payments that didn‚Äôt get recorded through the payment center, you may need to research those and add them to your calculation.

This should give you the amount of the arrears.&nbsp; If an order has been entered to allow interest on the money due, you would need to calculate that as well.&nbsp; Interest is set in Kansas law at 10% a year. (KSA 16-204).

Can I get my&nbsp;child support&nbsp;put directly into my bank account?

There are forms on the Kansas Payment Center website (www.kspaycenter.com) that can alert the payment center of your bank account. This will allow direct deposits to be made.&nbsp;


	This will speed up your receipt of the payment.&nbsp;
	Use the link for forms on the KPC website.


I changed banks, what do I do? &nbsp;

If your payments are direct deposited to your account, you can change the account by completing the form at&nbsp;www.kspaycenter.com.


	The form requires some information from the bank and a VOIDED check (which cannot be a starter check without your name).


What is an Income Withholding Order?

When a Kansas court issues a&nbsp;child support&nbsp;order, the order&nbsp;allows the recipient of the child support to obtain an Income Withholding Order.&nbsp;


	This Order can be served on the employer of the person who has to pay child support.&nbsp;
	Once served, the employer should start taking the child support amount out of the employee‚Äôs pay and sending it to the Kansas Payment Center.&nbsp;
	The Income Withholding Order is specific to each case.


The payer of&nbsp;child support&nbsp;changed jobs. How do I get the new employer to pay me&nbsp;child support?

&nbsp;An Income Withholding Order needs to be ‚Äúserved‚Äù on the new employer.


	If an Income Withholding Order has been signed by the Judge, you can get a copy from the Clerk of the District Court.&nbsp;
	It can be mailed to the employer; it is best to send it by certified mail, so there is proof that it was sent.
	The new employer must file an answer with the Court within 30 days of service.&nbsp;
	
		The withholding of funds from wages and payment of&nbsp;child support&nbsp;should start within 30 days.&nbsp;
	
	
	Often the Court Trustee or Child Support Enforcement agency will help serve an Income Withholding order, based on information provided by the parent who receives child support.


How do I change the amount of&nbsp;child support&nbsp;that is paid to me?&nbsp; When can I ask for a change in support?

Specific circumstances must exist as a reason for a change in the amount of child support paid:


	An increase or decrease in the amount of income of one of the parents,
	A significant change in the amount paid for child care or medical insurance for the child, or,
	A change in the age bracket of the child.&nbsp;



	Under most circumstances, the change in child support must be at least a 10% change up or down.&nbsp; &nbsp;
	
		You will know if the amount of change is enough by completing a new child support worksheet.&nbsp;
	
	
	You can complete a new child support worksheet on an interactive form created by KLS here: &nbsp;Child Support Worksheet.
	
		A list of the information you need to complete the worksheet is there.
		The interactive interview does the calculation and creates the worksheet.&nbsp;
		This interactive interview only works for situations where the combined income of the parents is less than $50,000.&nbsp;
	
	
	This link is also available&nbsp;for you to purchase access to an online program where you can create worksheets if the parents make more than $50,000 a year combined.
	The actual change in support must be made by a Court Order.
	
		See the question below on how to seek a change in the amount of child support. &nbsp;
	
	


NOTE:&nbsp; A parent should be aware that efforts to increase child support may result in the inclusion of the costs of children born to the paying parent after the date of the prior calculation of child support. (SEE PARAGRAPH BELOW ON CAUTIONS)


	This could end up reducing the amount you get. Be careful to really consider the possible outcomes before making such a request. It may not always go your way.


&gt; The rules for this are at Section V of the&nbsp;Kansas Child Support Guidelines, page 23.

Are there any cautions about filing a motion to increase&nbsp;child support?

When a parent receiving support files a motion to increase support, the payer of support can include the fact that there are ‚Äúafter born‚Äù children (those would be younger children that were not considered when support was previously set).&nbsp;


	The inclusion of those children can reduce the amount of support paid.&nbsp;
	The costs of these children are only considered when a parent seeks an INCREASE in support.&nbsp;
	If this is your situation, obtain the financial information first (and separately) and consider the effect of these children (using the multi-family adjustment) before filing the motion to increase support.


Where do I go to get help collecting&nbsp;child support?

The lack of child support is a major reason that children live in poverty. Therefore, government programs assist families in collecting child support.

Every district court in Kansas has an arrangement for helping families collect child support. &nbsp;


	To contact Child Support Services during regular business days, call the Child Support Call Center (CSCC) toll free at 1-888-757-2445 (TTY 1-888-688-1666).
	
		A child support representative can discuss how to apply for services, support services in general, or answer questions about an existing child support case.
	
	
	Parents may also hire an attorney to assist them.
	In some counties, services are also available from a Court Trustee.&nbsp;
	
		You can check the website for the District Court in which your case is filed, to see what alternate support collection services are available.&nbsp;&nbsp;The websites are listed here.&nbsp; Look for listings for a Court Trustee.
	
	


What is the connection between&nbsp;child support&nbsp;and seeing my children?&nbsp; Can I stop paying because the mother won‚Äôt let me see my children?

Kansas law is specific regarding this question. &nbsp;There is no ‚Äúright‚Äù to see your child that is earned by paying child support.&nbsp; Alternatively, there is no ‚Äúright‚Äù to withhold parenting time because a parent does not pay child support.&nbsp;


	Research suggests that parents who have a close relationship with their child, developed by seeing the child regularly, are far more likely to pay their child support.&nbsp;
	Both child support and parenting time can be a part of Court orders, issued by a Judge who has&nbsp;jurisdiction&nbsp;over the parties.&nbsp;
	
		Failure to follow the Court orders can expose the parent to a finding of ‚Äúcontempt of Court,"" with the possibility of a fine, jail time or other sanctions (punishment) that the Court can grant, after a hearing.
	
	


Why does the State of Kansas keep part of the&nbsp;child support&nbsp;I pay?

If a child receives benefits from certain Federal programs, including TANF and Medical Assistance (Health Wave or KanCare), the parent applying for benefits must assign their right to collect child support to the State of Kansas.&nbsp;


	When child support is paid, the state keeps all of the support while the children are still on public benefits.&nbsp;
	When the children are off public benefits, the State of Kansas keeps a portion of the child support to repay the State for the money spent to support the children while the parents were not able to support the child/ren.


Why does the Court Trustee keep part of the&nbsp;child support&nbsp;I pay?

An enforcement fee equal to a small percent of the child support order is added to the child support amount.


	A small amount is added to the sum paid by the payer. The same amount comes out of the amount due the person receiving the child support.
	
		In this way, each parent pays ¬Ω of the enforcement fee.&nbsp;
	
	
	This enforcement fee funds the Court Trustee office, which is available to assist in collecting child support, should that service be needed in your case.


I make less than when my&nbsp;child support&nbsp;amount was set.&nbsp; How do I change the amount I pay?

The Court must order a reduction of child support, based on a request of the parent.&nbsp; This request is called a motion, which must be filed with the Clerk of the District Court and set for a hearing.&nbsp;


	You can read more about how to prepare and file that motion from this question: How do I file a motion to change the amount of child support, up or down?


As you consider a change in child support, remember that the Court will always assume you can make minimum wage, full time (about $1256 a month).


	This is called imputed wages.&nbsp; It is used whether you have no earnings, or earnings less than this amount.&nbsp;


If you left a higher paying job voluntarily (rather than due to a lay-off) or if you were terminated for misconduct:


	&nbsp;The Court may continue to use your higher wages as the basis for figuring your child support.&nbsp;


You should determine if you qualify for a change.&nbsp; Look at the answer to questions:


	How do I change the amount of child support that is paid to me?&nbsp;
	When can I ask for a change in support?&nbsp; and&nbsp;
	Are there any cautions about filing a motion to increase child support?


What is a&nbsp;Child Support&nbsp;Worksheet?

Child Support in Kansas is determined by rules contained in the Kansas Child Support Guidelines.&nbsp; These guidelines set up some math formulas for determining certain ratios and set child support based on the ages of the children and income of the parents.&nbsp;

A Child Support Worksheet is completed to show the calculations involved and the amount of child support to be paid.&nbsp; You can use this program below to complete a child support worksheet for your situation. This is a free service of Kansas Legal Services.


	Child Support Worksheet&nbsp;&nbsp;(Use this Kansas Legal Services interactive form when the combined income of both parents is less than $50,000)


What does ‚ÄúArrears‚Äù mean?

Arrears is the amount of support that has become due every month and is unpaid.&nbsp; No Judge can make the arrears go away.&nbsp;


	It may be possible to obtain an order that small monthly payments on the arrears be added to the current payments.


What does ‚ÄúImputed Income‚Äù mean?

The Court will always assume that each parent can make minimum wage, full time (about $1256 a month).&nbsp; This is called imputed wages/income.&nbsp; It is used whether the parent has no earnings, or is earning less than this amount.&nbsp;You can read more about that rule&nbsp;here.

My income went down three months ago, but I didn‚Äôt think about my&nbsp;child support&nbsp;until just now.&nbsp; Can the Judge change support for the past?

No, every month that ends creates a final legal judgment of child support due.&nbsp; Any motion seeking a change in child support can only change support beginning in the next month after the motion is filed.

How do I file a motion to change the amount of&nbsp;child support, up or down?

If you qualify, you should file your motion seeking to change the amount of child support as soon as possible. You can use the interactive interview here.&nbsp;


	Child Support Worksheet&nbsp;&nbsp;(Use this Kansas Legal Services interactive form when the combined income of both parents is less than $50,000). This is a free service of Kansas Legal Services.
	A commercial provider is one option for obtaining a child support worksheet for combined incomes higher than $50,000.&nbsp; You can learn about that here &nbsp;Child Support Worksheet&nbsp;from childsupporttools.com. You must pay a fee to use this form.


If the amount that child support should decrease or increase is more than 10% of the total support, you can use this interactive interview to create the necessary paperwork to file your request in Court.&nbsp;


	Find the interview here:&nbsp;Modification of Child Support in Kansas.&nbsp; There is a filing fee of $42 for filing the motion to reduce child support, as of February, 2013. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


I give my girlfriend everything she wants for the baby, but she is still asking for&nbsp;child support.&nbsp; Do I have to pay?

The payment of child support covers expenses like housing and utility costs, insurance and transportation.&nbsp; Paying for the diapers, formula and clothes are important, but they are not the only costs of providing for the baby.&nbsp;


	You are better off paying child support and only buying those ‚Äúextras‚Äù when you want to.&nbsp;


Another problem with not paying child support is that the State of Kansas may request that you reimburse the support they, the state, are providing the child through benefits like TAF (Transitional Assistance to Families), so you may give money to your girlfriend regularly and still have to reimburse the State of Kansas.&nbsp;


	Paying under a Court Order, through the Kansas Payment Center, is, partly, for your protection and to have proof that you have paid your obligation.


My husband and I just had a baby.&nbsp; He pays&nbsp;child support&nbsp;to other children.&nbsp; Can we reduce the support be pays them, so we can afford this baby?

&nbsp;A baby born after child support is set by the Court is NOT a change of circumstances that justifies a decrease of child support.&nbsp;

(See page 8, Multiple Family Application, Kansas Child Support guidelines&nbsp;here.) &nbsp;


	The theory behind this rule is that the costs of the oldest children should be taken into account when the decision was made to have the new child.&nbsp;
	The costs of the new baby should not decrease the standard of living of the older children.&nbsp; &nbsp;


Who claims the child as a dependent on their tax return?

This matter should be determined in a Court order as part of the divorce decree, if the parents are married.&nbsp; The parties should be careful to follow that Court order.&nbsp;


	The usual situation is for the parents to alternate who takes the dependent deduction for the children.
	If there is one child, it is usually alternated each year, with one parent taking the child in odd years and the other in even years.&nbsp;
	
		The ‚Äúyear‚Äù refers to the year that the income was earned, not the year the tax return is filed.&nbsp;
	
	
	If there are two children or an even number of children, the parents can each take a portion of the children for the dependent care deduction.
	
		The parents should be clear about which children each is claiming, as the child‚Äôs name and Social Security number is a part of the information provided to the IRS.&nbsp;
	
	
	A parent should be careful to modify their W-4 each year, so that the correct amount is withheld from their earnings.&nbsp;
	
		That form should be turned in to their employer early in the year.&nbsp; The form is located on the IRS website&nbsp;here.&nbsp;
	
	
	If one parent chooses not to ‚Äúshare‚Äù the income tax deduction, then the Court may modify the amount of child support paid or collected to compensate for the failure to share the deduction.
	The alternated deduction is ONLY the dependent deduction.&nbsp; Other deductions including the Head of Household, Child Care Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Deduction are covered by rules of the IRS for who can claim the child/ren.&nbsp; &nbsp;
	If there is No Court order, then the residential parent (the parent with whom the child lives with more than ¬Ω the nights of the year) may claim the child as a dependent on their income tax return.
	
		There are IRS rules that allow the non-residential parent to claim the child only if the parents lived completely separately for the final 6 months of the tax year, the child lived with and was supported by the parents and the parent‚Äôs agree that the non-residential parent will take the dependent deduction.&nbsp; (This might occur where the residential parent has no income, so there is no advantage to claiming the child as a dependent.)&nbsp;
		The residential parent must sign an IRS form that can be found&nbsp;here.&nbsp;This form is attached to the tax refund of the parent claiming the deduction.
		More information can be found&nbsp;here&nbsp;about the IRS rules.
	
	


Where can I find out about the&nbsp;Child Support&nbsp;services provided by the Kansas Department for Children and Family Services?

You can read more about those services&nbsp;here. &nbsp;

My child is in state custody. What about&nbsp;child support?

When a child is in the custody of the state, as part of a Child in Need of Care (CINC) action, the Judge should set an amount of child support owed by each parent.


	That money is due to the state, since the state may be paying the person who is caring for the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;


If the Court does not have or use correct income information in setting support, a parent can file a new Child Support Worksheet and seek to have the monthly support amount decreased.&nbsp; However, don‚Äôt delay in doing this.&nbsp; Once each month passes, the Judge cannot change the Court order for support. &nbsp;It becomes final.

What is a Domestic Relations&nbsp;Affidavit&nbsp;(DRA)?

This Court form is required to obtain financial and other information needed by the Court to make certain decisions.&nbsp; The form can be found&nbsp;here. &nbsp; &nbsp;

In some situations, the Court requires less information contained in a mini-DRA or Short form ‚ÄìDRA.&nbsp; One example of a Short Form Domestic Relations&nbsp;Affidavit&nbsp;can be found among the forms on&nbsp;this page. Forms available on some County Court websites include the mini-DRA preferred by that Court.

How can I find out how much money my former&nbsp;spouse&nbsp;is making? &nbsp;

In advance of a motion to modify child support, you may request financial information from the other party.&nbsp; You can word your request something like this:


I am making a written request for information about your current earnings.&nbsp; Please supply me with a copy of the following:&nbsp; (Check what you believe you need to see, based on the circumstance of the other party)

_______&nbsp;Current Pay Stub &nbsp;

_______ Last Year‚Äôs Tax Return including schedules

_______&nbsp;W-2 &nbsp;

&nbsp;______ Written Proof of Day Care Cost

_______&nbsp;Written Proof of Insurance Costs &nbsp;

Under the Kansas Child Support Guidelines (SectionV.B.), you have 30 days to provide me this information.&nbsp; If you refuse to provide it, the Court may make you responsible for the costs and expenses, including attorney fees, which I must spent to obtain this information from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely, (Name)



	Although not required, you may wish to file a copy of your dated and signed request with the Court.
	If you don‚Äôt get the information you request, you can consider filing a motion in the Family Law case asking for a court order to obtain the information.&nbsp; It is also possible to&nbsp;subpoena&nbsp;this information from the employer.&nbsp; You may want to use an attorney to file the subpoena.
	Although you can file a motion to increase child support and request the needed financial information, you should use caution, if the payer of support has children younger than the children for which you seek support.&nbsp;
	
		When a parent receiving support files a motion to increase support, the payer of support can include the fact that there are ‚Äúafter born‚Äù children (those would be younger children not considered when support was previously set).&nbsp; Those children can reduce the amount of support paid.&nbsp;
		The costs of these children are only considered when a parent seeks an INCREASE in support.&nbsp; If this is your situation, obtain the financial information first (and separately) and consider the effect of these children (using the multi-family adjustment) before filing the motion to increase support.
	
	


How is support figured if I or the adverse claims to have no income?&nbsp; &nbsp;

Child support guidelines assume that anyone can earn minimum wage, on a full time basis. Therefore, child support is set on that basis, even if that is not the true situation. This is called ‚Äúimputing income."" &nbsp;(See imputed income above)

The circumstances under which income is not ‚Äúimputed‚Äù to a person with little or no income is when the parent receives TAF (Transitional Assistance to Families ) benefits from the Department of Children and Families or receives SSI (Supplemental Security Income) from the Social Security Administration.

Can imputing income to the residential parent increase my&nbsp;child support?

The rules say that income can be imputed to the residential parent, but it should not increase the child support of the non-residential parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

(See Page 3, Kansas Child Support Guidelines&nbsp;here.)

Where can I read Kansas law on&nbsp;Child Support?

The Kansas Statutes contain the laws about child support.&nbsp; You can read them on the Kansas Legislature website&nbsp;here.

The&nbsp;Child Support Guidelines&nbsp;provide the better explanation of the method of calculating child support.

Where can I read the Kansas&nbsp;Child Support&nbsp;guidelines?

The complete Kansas Child Support guidelines are published on the Kansas Supreme Court‚Äôs website&nbsp;here.

How does the parenting time for the children affect the amount of&nbsp;child support?

The Kansas Child Support Guidelines&nbsp;allow a reduction in child support, if both parents are accepting a substantial amount of the expenses of the children by providing for them (having parenting time) a substantial amount of time.


	This is calculated by tracking the amount spent with each parent.&nbsp; For an explanation of making these computations, see the explanation&nbsp;here.


-Once the calculations are made, this chart will show the percentage decrease in child support that is based on the parenting time split of the parents:


	
		
			
			Nonresidential Parent‚Äôs Parenting Time
			
			
			% of Child‚Äôs Time Adjustment
			
		
		
			
			35%-39%
			
			
			-5%
			
		
		
			
			40%-44%
			
			
			-10%
			
		
		
			
			45%-49%
			
			
			-15%
			
		
	



	This reduction is included in the Child Support Worksheet, on line E 2.


My child is 18.&nbsp; Do I still owe&nbsp;child support?

Child support does not end until June 30 of the year following your child‚Äôs graduation from high school, provided the child is still attending high school.&nbsp; You can read the Kansas law&nbsp;here.


	The child support should end automatically.&nbsp;
	However, if an income withholding order is in place, a motion to terminate or reduce child support may be required.&nbsp;
	
		You can find an interactive interview to create the necessary motion/paperwork&nbsp;here.
		The Court order will modify or terminate the Child Support order and the Income Withholding Order that is used to collect the child support.
	
	


One of my children has graduated from high school.&nbsp; Should I seek modification of&nbsp;child support?

Some people think that if they have two children and one reaches an age that child support is no longer owed, their child support should reduce by one half.&nbsp; THIS IS NOT TRUE.&nbsp;


	A motion to modify child support, looking at the age, health insurance costs, etc. must be filed to determine the amount of child support due going forward.&nbsp;
	A new child support worksheet should be completed to determine the amount of child support that is due under the Kansas Child Support Guidelines.&nbsp;
	
		You can complete this worksheet&nbsp;here, for circumstances where the combined income of the parents is $50,000 or less. &nbsp;
		The page lists all the information needed to complete the worksheet.&nbsp; The link to the interactive interview is at the bottom of the page.
	
	


What if I am disabled and can‚Äôt pay support?

Under Kansas Child Support Guidelines, money received from SSI (Supplemental Security Income) is excluded as income in computing Child Support.&nbsp;


	This has the effect of making a person who only receives SSI pay no child support.&nbsp;


Any other person who is disabled will have the actual amount of income they receive considered in computing child support.&nbsp; This could be from Social Security disability or a private disability policy.&nbsp;


	A person who is not working, due to disability, will likely have their child support computed based on the rules that impute minimum wage, full time income to all parents, even when actual income is below that.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;


If child support has been set and either the payer of child support or the parent receiving child support begins receiving Supplemental Security Income:


	That parent can return to Court and seek a reduction of child support.&nbsp;
	
		This can be done using the forms and instructions available&nbsp;here.&nbsp;
		You should use the Motion to Modify Child Support interactive interview.
	
	


The federal Social Security disability program makes payments to dependents of the disabled person.&nbsp; This can include a&nbsp;spouse&nbsp;and minor children.&nbsp;


	Once a parent has been approved for disability, the custodial parent should apply for dependent benefits at the Social Security Administration.&nbsp;


These payments are credited monthly as if the disabled parent had paid child support.&nbsp;


	If the payment is less than the monthly child support, then the disabled parent owes the difference.&nbsp;
	If the disability payment to the child is more than the support amount due, the full monthly support is deemed to have been made. The disabled parent does not get any credit for the extra in future months.


Where can I find information and forms to modify or establish parenting time?

Those forms are available&nbsp;here.

Is it a crime to fail to pay&nbsp;child support? &nbsp;

The payment of child support is done under a Court order.


	Failure to follow that order can be punished as contempt of Court.
	&nbsp;Among the penalties possible are a jail sentence.&nbsp;
	It is the goal of the legal system to require compliance with orders. A jail sentence imposed for failure to follow court orders can be avoided by complying with those orders.


If the order is for payment of support, then paying support will avoid the jail sentence.


	Often the Judge will approve a plan that pays current support and a regular payment on the past support (arrearage), to avoid a jail sentence.


Kansas law creates a&nbsp;lien&nbsp;on any vehicle, boat or aircraft owned by someone who is at least 30 days behind in paying child support.


	This lien can be enforced by forcing the sale of the property subject to the lien. In addition, this lien can delay the sale of the property and cause the proceeds of the sale to be used to pay the lien.


Child support due and unpaid can be reported to credit bureau.


	The Kansas Department of Children and Families Child Support Enforcement division can report unpaid child support and attach a Federal or State income tax return due to a payer of child support.


The process for contempt of Court (read about it&nbsp;here) also allows a court to suspend the driver‚Äôs license of any person who is behind in support more than 6 months, and has the means to pay that support. &nbsp;

Kansas law KSA 21-5606 sets out the crime of Criminal Non-support.&nbsp;

Federal criminal charges are occasionally filed against a parent who leaves one state specifically to avoid paying child support.

Can I hire an attorney to do just part of a case?&nbsp;

You can hire an attorney just to&nbsp;subpoena&nbsp;financial information from the opposing party or to review or prepare a child support worksheet. &nbsp;

Some attorneys are willing to provide ‚Äúlimited scope representation,"" where the amount of work the attorney does is determined in writing, between the client and the attorney.


	This limitation on attorney work (or rather sharing of tasks between the client and the attorney) is authorized by Kansas Supreme Court rules posted&nbsp;here.

*the heading of the case will read:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Kansas (Plaintiff)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abuser (Defendant)

*the State of Kansas is the Plaintiff; you are a witness and will probably be called to testify at any hearings

*although the State will listen to your recommendations ‚Äì ultimately, the State makes the final decisions regarding plea agreements and sentencing

*since you are not the Plaintiff, you cannot ‚Äúdrop‚Äù the charges ‚Äì only the State can make such decisions (as they are the Plaintiff)

PFA&nbsp;

*the heading of the case will read

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victim (Plaintiff)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abuser (Defendant)

*you are the Plaintiff in the case ‚Äì you must show the court you have been victimized and need a Protection Order to prevent further incidents

*you decide what you want the court to do (i.e. order counseling, give you custody of your children, divide personal property, etc.)

*you can ‚Äúdrop‚Äù the case

How do I know if I qualify for a PFA?

&nbsp;In order to qualify to receive a PFA, you must be able to show that you and the Defendant either:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; at one time, lived together; or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; had a child together

Additionally, you need to be able to show that the Defendant either:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; physically harmed you or your child(ren); or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; by physical threat, put you or your child(ren) in fear of physical violence; or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; performed some lewd act on a child under the age of 16

It is important to note that usually the court requires the abuse be imminent. This means the abuse needs to be recent. A good rule of thumb would be that if the abuse occurred more than three months ago, you are probably not eligible for a PFA. However, incidents of past abuse are useful in showing a Judge you have a real and imminent fear of future violent incidents because of the Defendant‚Äôs past actions.

How do I file a PFA?

The Clerk of the District Court in your county courthouse can direct you to the forms.&nbsp; When you go to fill out the forms, you will be completing several pages of paperwork.&nbsp; You may also meet with the Judge or another Court officer.&nbsp; It is best if you don‚Äôt take children with you.

What Important Information should be included in the Petition?

1. If you want the PFA to restrict the Defendant‚Äôs access to your child(ren) (i.e. provide for no contact, counseling, supervised visits, etc.) make sure to include your child(ren)‚Äôs names on the Petition.

2. If the PFA asks for you to describe the facts surrounding the incident, it is extremely important you make specific allegations of abuse. You will most likely be held only to the events you listed on the PFA Petition (for example: if you only allege an incident of abuse on June 12th, you might not be able to tell the court about the other incidents that occurred on May 15th, May 30th and June 1st). It is far better to say: the Defendant has been physically violent to me (and my children) numerous times over the past several&nbsp; days/months/years with the most recent incident occurring on June 12th. If you do not know the exact dates, do not guess ‚Äì just say the Defendant was abusive to me last Thursday, last week, last month, etc.

Is there anything specific I need to make known to the court when I file?

If you currently have a divorce or paternity action on file involving both you and the Defendant (even if the divorce or paternity action has been completed), it is extremely important you notify the Clerk:&nbsp; often, the PFA must be heard by the same judge who heard your divorce or paternity action.

What happen after I file?

A court date will be set usually 20 days from the date you filed your PFA Petition. Generally, Temporary Orders will be issued in connection with the Petition. These Temporary Orders are only in effect until the date of the hearing. The Defendant will be served with the Petition and notified of the hearing date. Once the Defendant has been served with the Petition, the ‚Äúno contact‚Äù provisions go into effect. If the Defendant contacts you at all (in person, by telephone, etc.) you need to call the police immediately and file a report. Any contact is a violation of the Temporary Orders and can submit the Defendant to contempt of court charges. It is very important that you follow through with every incident violating the Temporary Orders.

What happens at the hearing?

There are generally three possible outcomes to a PFA hearing.

1. The Defendant does not appear. Generally, if the Defendant does not appear - you win. You will still need to explain to the judge why you are requesting a PFA (for the judge to determine whether or not you meet statutory requirements).

2. The Defendant appears pro se (without an attorney). If the Defendant has no attorney, generally, the Judge will ask if the Defendant will agree to having ‚Äúno contact‚Äù with the victim for the next year. If he agrees, a PFA final Order will be entered without a finding of fault. If he does not agree to the entering of orders, the hearing will be necessary. The Defendant can also request a continuance to hire an attorney.

3. The Defendant appears with an attorney. If the Defendant appears with an attorney a couple of things can happen. First, your attorney and the Defendant‚Äôs attorney can reach some sort of agreement. If you do not have an attorney, you can request a continuance from the Judge to give you time to find an attorney. If no agreement is reached, a hearing must be held on the matter.

What is the actual hearing like?

The hearing is similar to a miniature trial. The Judge will probably begin by swearing you, the Defendant and any witnesses to tell the truth. You will then proceed to take the stand and testify to the events leading up to your filing of the PFA. It is very important for you to use action words to describe the incident; such as, ‚Äúhe shoved me‚Äù, ‚Äúshe kicked me‚Äù or ‚Äúhe threatened to kill me‚Äù. If the relationship was abusive in the past, highlight some of the more abusive incidents. After you testify, the Defendant (or his/her attorney) will then have a chance to ask you questions about your testimony. Once you and any witnesses you have testify, the Defendant will then get to testify as to his/her version of the events. After the Defendant testifies, you (or your attorney) will have a chance to ask questions of the Defendant. The Judge, after hearing the testimony, will make a final decision regarding the PFA. It is the Judge‚Äôs job to listen to the evidence and decide who is telling the truth.

What is proper courtroom etiquette?

*stand when the Judge enters the room

*never interrupt the Judge

*do not resort to name calling or swearing in the courtroom

*do not speak to the Defendant (especially if a ‚ÄúNo Contact‚Äù Order is in place)

*do not sigh, roll your eyes or shake your head in disagreement with either the Judge or the Defendant

*do not have gum in your mouth while speaking to the Judge

*turn off cell phones, pagers, etc. while in the courtroom

What do I do after I receive my final orders of Protection?

Ask the Clerk to make at least three copies. Make sure to always keep one in your purse, one in your car and one at home. Additionally, if the Defendant is restrained from your child(ren)‚Äôs daycare provider or school, you should also get a copy to take to the school or day care.

*If child support or maintenance is ordered through the PFA, you need to go to the Court Trustee‚Äôs Office (4th Floor) to complete necessary paperwork. The paperwork will insure the Trustee knows about the Support Order and can begin to enforce the Order.

* Remember the PFA is only a piece of paper; you need to take necessary steps and precautions to keep yourself and your child(ren) safe. Always report any violations of the Order (phone calls, encounters, etc.) to your local police department ‚Äì violations can subject the Defendant to prosecution for Contempt of Court.

What do I do if I want to drop the PFA?

If you wish to drop the PFA, the Court Clerk‚Äôs office has the necessary forms. You will need to complete the forms and then have the Judge who issued the ‚ÄúNo Contact‚Äù Order sign off on your dismissal. Do not drop the PFA if you still have concerns about your or your child(ren)‚Äôs safety.

317,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1673,The number of Kansas children in foster care continues to grow,,,Family Law,"&nbsp;More children are entering the system and fewer are being adopted&nbsp;By&nbsp;Dave Ranney&nbsp;&nbsp;KHI News Service&nbsp; &nbsp;Aug. 12, 2013TOPEKA&nbsp;‚Äî Over the last two years, near-record numbers of children have entered the state‚Äôs foster care system.At the same time, fewer children have exited and the number of adoptions involving children in state custody has fallen to a six-year low.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trend,‚Äù said Lois Rice, executive director with CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Johnson and Wyandotte Counties. ‚ÄúIn just our two counties, we had 610 CINC (child-in-need-of-care) petitions filed in 2008; in 2012 we had 975. That‚Äôs a 60 percent increase in four years, and this year‚Äôs numbers are looking like they‚Äôll be higher than last year‚Äôs.‚ÄùAcross the state, CASA offices recruit, train, and coordinate the activities of volunteers who befriend children in state custody, listen to their wants and needs, and advocate on their behalf.Children are placed in foster care after a judge rules their safety or welfare is in jeopardy, usually due to parental abuse or neglect. They‚Äôre allowed to return to their families once a judge decides those problems have been resolved.The average stay in foster care in Kansas is 16 months, though it‚Äôs not unusual that a child might spend several years in the system.In Sedgwick County, the state‚Äôs most populous after Johnson County, the average number of children in out-of-home placements has increased from 950 in fiscal 2011 to 1,319 in fiscal 2013.On June 30 across Kansas, there were 5,719 children in out-of-home foster care settings, a mix of foster homes, relatives‚Äô homes, group homes, psychiatric facilities, and juvenile detention facilities.That‚Äôs only the second time in the past 10 years that the number has exceeded 5,700 on the final day of the state‚Äôs fiscal year. The last time was in 2008, the onset of the Great Recession.The actual number of children in out-of-home placements varies from month to month. The numbers posted on June 30 provide a ‚Äúsnapshot ‚Äúof annual trends.Concerning trendAlso on June 30, there were 975 children in foster care whose parents‚Äô rights had been terminated and who were available for adoption. The most in at least the past four years and perhaps ever, if the memories of a former state welfare official are correct.‚ÄúI know that the definition of ‚Äòawaiting adoption‚Äô has changed over the years, but I don‚Äôt think we ever got where we had 975 kids in the system and available for adoption,‚Äù said Joyce Allegrucci, an assistant secretary for child and family services at the state Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services from 1998 through 2001. ‚ÄúIf we ever got to 975 kids, we weren‚Äôt there for very long.‚ÄùAllegrucci said ‚Äúsomething is wrong‚Äù when the state‚Äôs foster care system has ‚Äú500 more kids than it did a year ago or 18 months ago‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs a trend we should all be concerned about.‚ÄùOfficials at the Kansas Department for Children and Families said they were aware of the foster care situation.‚ÄúThe current administration inherited a difficult economy and troubling trends when it comes to the numbers of children entering and exiting state custody,‚Äù Theresa Freed, a spokesperson for the agency, wrote in an email to KHI News Service.‚ÄúWe are looking at how we can integrate more preventative services with our community partners, so that families never reach the point of crisis and require state intervention,‚Äù she wrote.The agency, she said, is committed ‚Äú‚Ä¶to keeping families together when it is safe to do so.‚ÄùThough the total number of Kansans ages 0-19 has increased during the same period that foster care cases have gone up, the increase in foster care has outpaced the rate of population growth.DCF officials have attributed the increase largely to the weak economy and parental drug abuse. But the numbers have not improved as the economy has and the percentage of foster care cases attributed to drug or alcohol problems has remained steady over the past few years.Policy changesChildren‚Äôs advocates said they see other potential reasons for the increase.Recent changes in state policies have resulted in thousands of needy families losing their welfare benefits, straining parents‚Äô abilities to care for their children. It‚Äôs not surprising, the advocates said, that more children are ending up in foster care.DocumentTANF Caseload Reduction Report&nbsp;View Document‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely a need to carefully examine these numbers and determine what‚Äôs happened in the course of the last two years that‚Äôs increased the rate of out-of-home placements, reduced the number of finalized adoptions, and increased the numbers of kids awaiting adoptions,‚Äù said Shannon Cotsoradis, chief executive with the advocacy group Kansas Action for Children.According to DCF reports, 14,204 families received cash assistance in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2011. Two years later there were 7,790.The number of working parents receiving child-care assistance dropped from to 9,953 in fiscal 2011 to 8,163 in fiscal 2013.The policy changes, Cotsoradis said, limited beneficiaries‚Äô eligibility for cash assistance to 48 months instead of 60 months and required them to apply for at least 20 jobs a week.And to qualify for the child-care aid, low-income parents now must work 30 hours a week instead of 20.DCF officials have said that stiffer requirement was meant to encourage parents to find work instead of depending on government programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocates for the poor, however, say many parents ‚Äî particularly young mothers working low-wage, part-time jobs ‚Äî are unable to find the second or third jobs needed to meet the 30-hour requirement. Without the subsidies, they struggle to pay child-care bills.&nbsp;Another DCF policy allows the agency to take away an entire family‚Äôs benefits, if any child in the household is truant.‚ÄúThe changes went into effect in 2011, and in 2012 and 2013 we see a rather significant increase in the number of kids going into foster care and a 150-kid decrease in the number of kids being adopted,‚Äù Cotsoradis said. ‚ÄúThe bottom line here, I think, is that these are families that are more fragile than they were just a couple years ago.‚ÄùKellie Hogan, an attorney at Kansas Legal Services in Wichita.&nbsp;Services harder to findKellie Hogan, a Kansas Legal Services attorney in Wichita, said she has noticed that parents whose children are in foster care appear to be having a harder time finding and paying for the services they need to get their children back home.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the way it is,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf a parent can‚Äôt get or doesn‚Äôt have access to the community supports they need to take care of their kids, then those kids are going to remain in the system. I see a lot of parents struggling with that.‚ÄùIncreasingly, these services either aren‚Äôt available or have long waiting lists, said Wendy Flickinger, outreach coordinator for the Family Advisory Council, a Hutchinson-based program that helps parents navigate the foster care system.‚ÄúNobody is saying kids should stay in a home that isn‚Äôt safe,‚Äù Flickinger said. ‚ÄúBut if a kid is living in a filthy house, let‚Äôs go in and show mom how to clean it up. If you‚Äôve got a young mom who‚Äôs got three kids and has never had anyone show her how to parent, let‚Äôs go in and mentor her. That‚Äôs hard to do when the funding for those services (local anti-poverty and mental health programs) keeps getting cut like it has.‚ÄùFlickinger said her program helps about 100 families a year. Most of them, she said, involve parents who are working low-wage jobs and are not eligible for cash assistance.‚ÄúThis is just my personal opinion,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I think the State of Kansas is trying to balance the budget on backs of the poor because so many programs and services that lower-income people need to survive are being cut. And yet&nbsp;we‚Äôre giving the upper-income people tax deductions.‚ÄúI know how it‚Äôs all supposed to trickle down and lead to more people being employed. I‚Äôm all for that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think we ought to be cutting all these services to people who are poor.‚ÄùDiana Frederick runs the CASA program in Lawrence.&nbsp;Psychiatric careDiana Frederick, who runs the CASA program in Lawrence, said she‚Äôs seen an increase in the number of foster care cases involving mentally ill children who, earlier, likely would have been referred to one of the state‚Äôs Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities.Many of these children, she said, have had their lengths of stays shortened as part of the&nbsp;state‚Äôs effort to rein in costs and lessen families‚Äô reliance on institutional care.In fiscal 2010, prior to the policy change, the average number of children in the facilities per month was 683. And there were 17 facilities, according to state reports.Last month, there were only 216 children in the PRTFs and the number of facilities had dropped to 11, according to DCF numbers shared with PRTF officials.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening is they‚Äôre not able stay in a PRTF as long as they should, they go back to a foster home, their resource parents can‚Äôt handle them, and they end up in crisis,‚Äù Frederick said. ‚ÄúIn some cases, maybe they didn‚Äôt need to be in a PRTF any longer than they were, but that‚Äôs not to say they were ready to go back to a foster home either. There needs to be something in between, but there isn‚Äôt a lot of times.‚ÄùFreed said she didn‚Äôt know if cuts in services were a factor in the growth of cases and said other agency officials were too busy with other work to respond to questions about that. She suggested contacting the state‚Äôs foster care contractors to see what they had to say about it.Kyle Kessler, executive vice president of KVC Behavioral Health Care, Inc., one of the state‚Äôs two major foster care contractors.&nbsp;Freed specifically recommended Kyle Kessler, executive vice president of KVC Behavioral Health Care, Inc., one of the state‚Äôs two major foster care contractors.Anticipated efficienciesKessler said KVC officials were expecting the number of foster care cases to drop this fiscal year and also attributed much of the recent increase in cases to substance abuse.‚ÄúWe think there will be some efficiencies in the combining of the contracts and we‚Äôre excited to see what those efficiencies might be,‚Äù he said.The combining of contracts Kessler referred to stems from Kansas privatizing most of its foster care system in 1996, after the system failed several court-ordered reviews. Between 1997 and 2013, the state paid as many as six nonprofit organizations to oversee its foster care, adoption, and family preservation efforts.Earlier this year, DCF announced&nbsp;that two of the organizations ‚Äî St. Francis Community Services, Salina, and KVC Behavioral Healthcare, Olathe ‚Äî had been awarded the family preservation and foster care contracts. The decision meant that United Methodist Youthville, Wichita; TFI Family Services, Topeka; and DCCCA, Lawrence, would lose their contracts.&nbsp;The contracts changed hands on July 1.DCF expects to pay St. Francis and KVC $80.7 million and $70.2 million, respectively, in fiscal 2014.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already thinking that FY 14‚Äôs numbers are going to be better than FY 13‚Äôs,‚Äù Kessler said. ‚ÄúBut big picture-wise, I have to say we‚Äôre seeing a lot of substance abuse on the part of both the parents and the kids.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying any of this is new,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not going away either.‚ÄùHe said he hadn't heard anyone raise concerns about the policy changes that had reduced the number of people receiving welfare benefits.""I just haven‚Äôt heard the concerns about reductions in the type of services you mention,"" he said. ""Also, I have not heard any comments about cash assistance reductions increasing foster care referrals.""Freed said DCF has been ‚Äúactively working to recruit foster and adoptive families.‚ÄùAccording to figures from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the numbers of licensed foster homes in Kansas has been between 2,415 and almost 2,500 for the past six years. Last year‚Äôs total, 2,486, was the most since 2009.Last year, 391 of the 620 adoptions involving children in state custody were adopted by their foster parents. More than half of the adoptions involved children who were five years old or younger.The KHI News Service is an editorially independent initiative of the Kansas Health Institute and is committed to timely, objective and in-depth coverage of health issues and the policy making environment.

‚Äú‚Ä¶In the post-ACA era,&nbsp;health&nbsp;insurance isn‚Äôt the binder it once was for holding bad marriages together.&nbsp;With more options available on the market and preexisting conditions no longer an issue, people once reluctant to divorce for fear of losing health insurance coverage would do well to reconsider.‚Äù

Robert Clandra,&nbsp;Insurance No Longer May Hinder Divorce,&nbsp;The Inquirer, March 2014

Read about 2016's open enrollment period here.



Many people put off getting a divorce out of fear for their financial futures. Some of these fears often have to do with healthcare options.

In the past, stay-at-home moms, for example, may have waivered more for fear of getting kicked off their spouse‚Äôs health insurance plan and not being able to afford insurance on their own.

The Affordable Care Act seeks to ease these blocks through special enrollment for people going through a qualifying life event (see definition below).

In 2012, the University of Michigan&nbsp;released a study that found that 115,000 women lose their private health insurance every year in the wake of divorce.&nbsp;The study also found that women do not regain coverage quickly after a divorce. Roughly 65,000 of these women become uninsured. Many of the women:


	Did not have jobs outside the home;



	Worked at jobs that did not offer insurance;



	Could no longer afford the premiums of their employer-sponsored plans;



	Qualify for post-divorce COBRA health benefits under their ex-spouse's plan, but that is of a limited duration of 36 months - and is often too expensive.


Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, these people have other options.

Some people may be able to use special enrollment periods.

If you experience a ""qualifying life event,"" you'll still be able to sign up for private insurance in the Marketplace.&nbsp;


A qualifying life event is a change in your life that can make you suited for a Special Enrollment Period to enroll in health coverage.

Examples of qualifying life events are: moving to a new state, certain changes in your income (like changing jobs), and changes in your family size (for example, if you marry, divorce, or have a baby), etc.




If you are going through a divorce, you are fit for special enrollment. Once your divorce is complete, you will usually have 60 days to secure new coverage to avoid paying a penalty.

One detail you might want to remember is for when you file your taxes that year. You will need a document from your earlier health insurance company stating that you were insured for the first part of that year.

Depending on the nature of your divorce, you might want to be sure you can get that document directly from the insurance company.

You can also contact the Marketplace Call Center to apply by phone. Be sure to tell the agent that you believe you are fit for a Special Enrollment Period. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

342,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1847,Kansas Paternity Action,,,Family Law,"This page will provide information for parents who are unmarried and need court orders to establish parenting time, custody and child support.&nbsp;

&nbsp;A paternity suit is brought when a Court order is needed to identify the father of a child. This legal action allows the court to order child support and make orders about parenting time. Paternity issues may arise under some of the following circumstances:


	When the child is born to unmarried people and the mother is seeking child support;



	When the child is born to unmarried people and the state is seeking current or past due child support;



	When the child is born to unmarried people and the man is seeking to prove that he is the father of that child.


Doesn‚Äôt signing a birth certificate take the place of a paternity action?

Having the father sign a birth certificate is one of the things that creates a presumption of paternity.&nbsp; However, a court action is still needed so that agreements or Court orders about child support and parenting time can be made and enforced.

What if an action has been filed by Child Support Enforcement attorneys to determine paternity and get a child support order?&nbsp;&nbsp;

You don‚Äôt need to file a new action.&nbsp; That action establishes paternity and gets child support set.&nbsp; If you need a parenting plan to determine custody and parenting time, you can use the motion to establish parenting time. Click here.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

TOPEKA ‚ÄìKansas Department for Children and Families (DCF) Secretary Phyllis Gilmore and Kansas Department of Revenue (KDOR) Director of Vehicles Lisa Kaspar are pleased to announce a new service. The service is available for foster children and youth who have recently aged out of foster care. These young adults will now be able to get a photo ID at no cost. During fiscal year 2014, 331 young people aged out of foster care. Many of them do not have the needed photo ID to make this life transition. Photo IDs are needed for enrolling in school, applying for employment, enlisting in the military, etc.

‚ÄúChildren in foster care deserve every opportunity to succeed in life,‚Äù Governor Sam Brownback said. ‚ÄúThis is one small way we can help ensure they are able to build the future they deserve. Having something as simple as a photo ID will be one less hurdle they will have to overcome.‚Äù

Two Kansas Youth Advisory Council members approached DCF leaders recently and advised them of this need. One of the two KYAC members, Christian Sauerman, is now a DCF employee. He says he‚Äôs pleased to see this plan become a reality.

‚ÄúBeing able to get a photo ID is so important. For many youth in foster care, obtaining necessary documents and records can be difficult, and when you‚Äôre trying to transition to life on your own, you need all the help you can get,‚Äù Sauerman said.

KDOR is waiving the first ID fee for current/former foster care youth ages 16 to 23. DCF will pay for the cost of the photograph. KDOR is not charging DCF the processing fee. Youth must present a form that is approved by the child welfare provider or DCF staff and a birth certificate. Other forms of ID, such as a social security card or proof of home, are not required.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased to work with DCF to help these young people start their new, independent life. A photo ID is necessary for so many parts of life, from securing housing to getting a job,‚Äù Kaspar said.



Currently, 424 youth in foster care are preparing for this transition. Some of the challenges they face include having a good support system; safe, decent and cheap housing; gainful employment; and behavioral health support. In addition to the new photo ID service, DCF also offers other programs and services to help youth transition to life after foster care. DCF has an Independent Living (IL) program. Helping youth become successful adults involves joint efforts between multiple agencies and multiple programs.

‚ÄúAs an agency, we seek to provide the support youth need to become self-sufficient,‚Äù DCF Secretary Phyllis Gilmore said. ‚ÄúOver the past several years, we have added staff to our IL program to enhance services and supports available to current and former foster youth. It‚Äôs important that youth have these tools to become productive and fulfilled members of the community.‚Äù

Independent Living offers supports in the following areas:


	Secondary education support, including GED completion
	Post-secondary education support through the Kansas Foster Child Education Assistance Act‚Äîtuition and fees are waived through the semester the youth turns 23, at any Kansas Board of Regents vocational-technical school, community college or state university.
	Help with financial aid for school‚Äîeducation and training vouchers are available.
	Learning to live on their own‚Äîgrant funds are offered to secure an apartment and furniture and repair a vehicle.
	Seeking and maintaining employment‚Äîfunds help people with clothing/uniforms for jobs.
	Career training‚Äîeducation and training vouchers and the tuition waiver are available.
	Applying for medical benefits‚Äîaged out medical coverage is available until the last day of the month that the youth turns 26.

354,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1887,Johnson County Court offers free assistance for family law cases ,,,Family Law,"Posted on Nov. 3rd, 2014 &nbsp; gardneredge.com

The new Johnson County District Court Help Center is designed primarily to assist those who cannot afford an attorney in family law cases and in eviction cases. The Help Center is located on the first floor of the Johnson County Courthouse, (100 N. Kansas Avenue, Olathe.)

As part of the Johnson County District Court‚Äôs continuing efforts to provide access to the services it offers, the court opened its Help Center in a temporary space on May 1. On October 1 the Help Center welcomed patrons to the new, expanded and more permanent location.

‚ÄúThe Help Center was designed to meet the constitutional right of all citizens for access to our courts but who are unable to afford legal representation,‚Äù says Keven M. P. O'Grady. Johnson County District Court Judge.

‚ÄúWhile not intended to replace effective legal representation, The Help Center insures that unrepresented people obtain basic and necessary information about the laws, rules and procedures used in the court system in general and in Johnson County District Court that affect their cases.‚Äù

At the Help Center, clients involved in family law cases can locate, fill out and file the necessary papers and forms in one location. Qualifying individuals may obtain limited legal assistance from Kansas Legal Services staff attorneys on-site two days per week.

Over the coming months, the Help Center will expand into providing information and forms required in other areas of the law.

Reasons the Help Center is needed


	&nbsp;In 2013, there were 620 new divorce, paternity, and custody/support cases filed by parties without lawyers.
	A third of divorce cases without children involve unrepresented parties as do one in five divorces with children.
	There are continuing requests after the initial case is concluded that involve changes in parenting time or in the amount of child support or maintenance a parties pays or receives.


A large number of these motions involve at least one parent who is not represented by an attorney.

Family law cases require significant court time and resources and making sure that court approved forms are filed correctly will aid both the court and the parties.

Collaborative effort

The Help Center is a collaborative effort by Johnson County judges, the Johnson County Clerk of the Court and court staff who visited a similar and successful program used by New York courts.

Kansas Legal Services and the Johnson County Bar Foundation were instrumental in establishing the on-site attorney assistance program.

The Help Center is located on the first floor on the east side of the courthouse and will be open from 8:30 am until 5:00 pm Monday through Friday when the courthouse is open.

More information can be obtained about the Johnson County District Court (the 10th Judicial District) by visiting www.courts.jocogov.org. Click here to see the Help Center page.

domestic abuse
Abuse
intimate partner abuse
legal aid",Family Law,"By&nbsp;Lonnie A. Powers&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Director, Massachusetts Legal Assistance Corporation &nbsp; &nbsp;From the Huffington Post

When domestic violence makes national news, it is more often than not when a high profile celebrity is involved, as when&nbsp;Chris Brown was charged with assaulting his then-girlfriend Rhianna in 2009 or when the football player Ray Rice punched out his fiance, Janay Palmer.&nbsp;

These tragic stories often spark public debate and -- in some instances --&nbsp;legislative action&nbsp;on how to better aid victims and prevent future incidences of domestic violence.

A public health problem

Domestic violence is a complex public health problem that defies an easy solution. When it comes to domestic violence victims who are living in poverty, however, access to legal services is proven to prevent further violence and save lives.

Research shows that the availability of civil legal services significantly reduces the likelihood that someone will again be the victim of intimate partner violence. In 2000, two researchers at the Carnegie Mellon Census Research Data Center were intrigued by a&nbsp;U.S. Department of Justice report&nbsp;noting that rates of domestic violence had significantly declined during the 1990s. By analyzing data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as the U.S. Census, they concluded that access to civil legal services was a primary reason for the decline.

Violence went down when legal aid went up

Services provided by emergency shelters, counselors and hotlines are vital during a crisis. But access to protective orders, assistance with child custody and support, divorce and property distribution and domestic violence-related legal disputes around immigration, housing and public benefits help over the long-term as these services ""appear to actually present women with real, long-term alternatives to their relationships,"" the researchers concluded in their report, which was published in&nbsp;2003 in Contemporary Economic Policy.

Additionally, between 1994 and 2000, the period during which incidences of domestic violence declined, the availability of civil legal services for victims of domestic violence increased 245 percent (from 336 such programs to 1,441).

Strong legal advocacy is key

It is true that the court system can be scary and overwhelming for anyone, much less someone who comes to it in a vulnerable position to begin with. Without strong legal advocacy and other professional support for people in abusive relationships, their abusers can easily persuade or intimidate victims out of pursuing legal action.

A majority of the victims in the study were living in poverty. This fact once again reinforces the dire need for civil legal aid, which provides legal representation, advice, and information to low-income people with non-criminal legal problems such as domestic violence, child custody, or employment issues.

If we as a society are serious about preventing domestic violence, the expansion of civil legal aid for domestic violence victims must be in the policy mix. It makes no sense to ignore a tool proven to help individuals and families break free over the long-term from the cycle of violence and return to living safe, healthy and productive lives.

Protection from Abuse",Family Law,"

Domestic Violence Awareness Month (DVAM) started as a ""Day of Unity"" held in October 1981. The Day of Unity was started by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

The reason for the special day was to connect advocates across the nation who were working to end violence against women and their children. The Day of Unity soon became an entire week with a range of activities held at the local, state, and national level.

The activities were as different as the program sponsors but had common themes:


	Mourning those who have died because of domestic violence
	Celebrating those who have survived
	Connecting people who work to end violence


These three themes are still a focus of DVAM events today.

In October 1987, the first Domestic Violence Awareness Month was observed. The first national domestic violence toll-free hotline also started in 1987:&nbsp;&nbsp;1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

In 1989, the U.S. Congress passed a law to make October National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The legislation has passed every year since 1989. Each year, the Day of Unity is celebrated the first Monday of Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

Safety Planning",Family Law,"Safe At Home is an address privacy program made possible in Kansas for the victims of domestic or sexual abuse, trafficking or stalking. Through the program, approved members would receive their mail at an alternate address (a post office box) which would then be forwarded to their private home address.

This program is a great addition to any safety plan. Victims, their minor children or family members living in the same home as the victim can apply. All City, county and state offices must accept the alternate address of an approved participant and, although they don‚Äôt have to, private groups may chose do so as well. Through the program, participants can also register to vote while keeping their address private.

To apply:

Victims must meet with a certified enrolling assistant to discuss safety planning and complete the application form. A list of qualified enrolling agents is available here.

PFA Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 1/3: Preparing for Your PFA/PFS

Appropriate clothing for court




	General:

	
		‚ÄãDressing professionally and conservatively is a sign of respect for the judge and the court.
		Don‚Äôt go overboard though, you should still be comfortable.
		Avoid any clothing that is revealing or that has any explicit language or images on it.
		Cover any visible tattoos, if possible.
		Sunglasses and hats must be removed before entering the courtroom.
	
	
	Guys:
	
		Men should wear a suit or dress slacks and a dress shirt.
	
	
	Gals:
	
		Women should wear a conservative dress, business suit, or dress pants and a dress shirt.
		Flip flops, excessively high heels, and sneakers shouldn't be worn to a trial. Wear only necessary jewelry such as a wedding ring or watch.
		Don't wear heavy bracelets, earrings, or necklaces.
	
	
	Bottom line: Try to look clean and neat. Put your best foot forward. Use common sense.‚Äã


Kids and toddlers


	Children under the age of 18 will not be allowed in the courtroom. Keep that in mind when preparing for court.
	
		This means that your 13-year-old child won‚Äôt be able to testify as your witness, or your 6-year-old can‚Äôt come along and sit with you in court.
		Be sure to make arrangements for child care beforehand.
	
	


Bring a notebook with you to court


	You're going to want to take notes and it‚Äôs always a good idea to have a pen and paper ready.


Resources for reliable child care and transportation

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


	Child care: Make sure you have arrangements made for childcare for the day you have court. Do not bring your child or toddler with you to court, as you will not be able to bring them into the courtroom.‚Äã‚Äã

	
		If you do bring your child to court, make sure there is someone with you to sit with the child outside the courtroom while court is in session.
		If you have someone you trust that can watch your child or children that day, perfect!
		If not, you can find local day care facilities online or through your local yellow pages. One online resource for locating day care facilities near you: http://www.daycareresource.com/kansas.html
	
	


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äã


	Transportation: Make sure you plan out how you will get to court. Having reliable transportation is very important.

	
		If you have your own car, make sure you put gas in your tank the day before.
		Don‚Äôt have a car? Bus systems are great! Check out your local bus routes to map out and plan how you will make your way to court. Below are links to a few Kansas bus route websites (Wichita, Topeka, Lawrence, and Kansas City). &nbsp;
		
			http://www.wichitatransit.org/Pages/default.aspx
			http://www.topekametro.org/
			http://lawrencetransit.org/routes
			http://www.kcata.org/
		
		
		Don‚Äôt like the bus? Make arrangements with friends or sign up for Uber (the ride sharing service- there is a fee involved).
	
	


Value of having a support system there with you


	PFA and PFS proceedings can be hard. They force you to deal with an unpleasant circumstance in your life. You may be forced to see your abuser for the first time since the abuse, or, if the case goes to trial, be questioned by your abuser on the stand. Although we are all strong individually, it never hurts to have support.
	Bring a family member or trusted friend with you to court, if you can. This way you have someone in your corner reminding you just how capable and strong you are.
	
		REMEMBER: All the court rules and tips apply to family and friends too. Just because they are not a party to the case doesn‚Äôt mean they can mumble from their seat as the other side talks, or stay seated when asked to ‚Äúall rise‚Äù.
	
	
	There are also great advocates at the YWCAs and at shelters like the Willow Domestic Violence Shelter.
	
		They are trained to deal with situations like these and are there for you when you need them most.
		They‚Äôre very friendly and would love to be there for you.

Witnesses




	Bring with you anyone who has witnessed the abuse or stalking and who is willing to speak on your behalf.
	A letter from your witnesses is not enough. If you want someone to testify or to be a witness, you need them to be there in court.
	
		To make someone come to court, you use a subpoena form.
	
	
	Subpoena- You can use this form as a model: &nbsp;http://courts.jocogov.org/forms/SUBPOENA.PDF. &nbsp;
	
		You should change the caption at the top to include your county.
	
	


Evidence




	Write down dates of events and keep track of everything that is relevant.
	Print out and make copies of anything you plan on using in your case.
	Take picture of injuries or damage.
	If you want to enter anything into evidence, you‚Äôll need to make 3 copies- one for you, one for the court, and one for your opponent.
	Just showing the judge the screen of your phone isn‚Äôt enough.
	
		The court would have to enter the phone itself into evidence for it to be used if the information you want that‚Äôs on the phone isn‚Äôt printed off first.
	
	


Come early to docket


	There is a whole check in process you will need to go through. You will also need to factor time to find signs for the court number, etc.


Parking and meters


	Make sure you have change for meters and pay for enough time so that you don‚Äôt need to run out of court to feed the meter. Plan ahead.


Parenting and property issues:


	Be aware that if you have property at the other person‚Äôs house, or vice-versa, or if you have kids together, property exchanges and parenting time will be brought up.
	Bring case numbers with you: If you‚Äôve previously been in a divorce with the other party, bring that case number. If you‚Äôre involved in case having to do with your joint child or children with the other party, bring that case number too. Judges like to know if there are divorce, paternity, custody, or parenting time orders on file so they can consolidate the cases if need be.
	Have a plan: Have an idea of how you‚Äôll handle it and what you want to have happen ideally.
	Know what‚Äôs possible: Be aware of what the court can and can‚Äôt do. For example, it is rare that a court in a PFA hearing take away completely someone‚Äôs parenting rights or rights to visitation.


How to apply for a PFA/PFS and how to apply for KLS services


	Initial filing: These forms are provided by Kansas courts for use in filing for a Protection from Abuse order in Kansas.

Miscellaneous
Juveniles","emancipation
young adult",Family Law,"What is Emancipation?


	Emancipation means you are legally separated from your parents or guardian and do not have to live with them.&nbsp;
	The law in Kansas emancipates you when you are 18 years old.&nbsp;
	Having a baby does not make you legally emancipated.&nbsp;
	Your parents cannot emancipate you so they are no longer legally responsible for financially providing for you.&nbsp;
	It is possible to become emancipated prior to the age of 18, which is called an Emancipated Minor.&nbsp;
	
		If you will be 18 in six months or less, there is not time to complete the emancipation process before you turn 18 and are automatically emancipated.
	
	



What changes when you become emancipated?

If you become emancipated, you will have some of the rights that come with adulthood.

These rights include:


	Handling your own affairs
	Living where you choose
	Signing contracts
	Keeping and spending your money
	Consenting to all of your own medical care
	Getting a work permit without your parents‚Äô consent
	Suing someone in your own name
	Staying out as late as you want


Even if you are emancipated, you still must:


	Go to school.&nbsp; You must stay in school until you graduate from high school or reach the age of 18.
	You cannot work as many hours as you want.&nbsp; Your employer still must follow all child labor laws and work permit rules.
	Statutory rape laws still apply to you.&nbsp; If you have sex, your partner can still get in trouble with the law.
	You cannot legally drink alcohol until you are 21.
	You can‚Äôt vote until you are 18.


When you become emancipated:


	You lose your right to have financial support ‚Äì your basic living expenses and health care ‚Äì paid by your parents or guardian.
	Your parents or guardian will no longer be legally or financially responsible if you injure someone.
	Being emancipated does not automatically make you eligible for public benefits.



How can I get emancipated early?

Kansas‚Äôs law also allows early emancipation in certain circumstances.&nbsp;


	If you are 16 or over and married ‚Äì but you must have the written consent of parents or guardian and a court order to get married before you are 18.
	Enlisting in the military ‚Äì but you must have consent of your parents or guardian and permission by the armed services if you are under 18.
	By going to court and having the Judge declare you emancipated.&nbsp;To use this method, you must first satisfy all the following six requirements:&nbsp;



	You must be at least 14 years of age when you begin to seek legal emancipation.
	You must not be living with your parents or legal guardian.&nbsp; The court wants to be sure you have made living arrangements where you plan to stay for a long time.&nbsp; Saying you are staying with a friend is not good enough.
	Your parents or legal guardian must have consented/agreed to your living away from them.&nbsp; One way to do this is if they sign a consent to your Emancipation.&nbsp; If your parents sign this form, it will be easier for you to become emancipated.&nbsp; If your parents will not sign this form, you may be able to show the court that your parents have ‚Äúacquiesced‚Äù.&nbsp; If you are living away from home and your parents know all about this but they are not strongly objecting or trying to bring you back home to live, a judge MAY interpret their lack of action as an agreement to your living arrangements.
	You must manage your own financial affairs.&nbsp; The court needs to be sure you have income earned only by you and that you make the decision on how that income is spent.&nbsp; You will need to show evidence that you pay your own bills, especially for necessary things like housing, food and clothing.&nbsp; Even if you trade housework for room and board, it is best if you get paid and show that you are actually paying rent.&nbsp; There is no set amount you must earn, but the Judge will look at your income closely to make certain you can meet your expenses.
	Your source of income must be legal.&nbsp; You cannot earn your money from criminal activities.
	The emancipation must be in your best interest.&nbsp; This allows the Judge a lot of freedom in deciding if you should be emancipated.&nbsp; Even if you meet the other five requirements, a judge who feels it is not in your best interest to become emancipated can deny your request.&nbsp; In court, your parents or anyone else may object to your emancipation and try to persuade the judge that it is not in your best interest.



Process of emancipation:

If you decide emancipation is the right decision for you and you meet the requirements, you also must have lived in the county for 12 months to file.


	You will also need to pay a filing fee ‚Äì around $111.00 (you may be able to get a waiver not to pay the fees, but that can go against you in front of the judge).
	You may also have to pay a publication fee.&nbsp;
	The Clerk of your county court will have the necessary forms to fill out to file and can answer questions.&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Briefly, the process includes:


	Obtaining the forms from the Clerk‚Äôs office
	Completing the forms
	Filing the forms with the Court
	The petition goes to the Court for review.&nbsp;
	
		If there is no hearing, you will be notified by mail.&nbsp;
		If there is a hearing, the Court will decide who to notify so they can appear at the hearing.&nbsp;
		
			Your parents or legal guardian will have a right to receive an official notice of hearing, as well as SRS or the Probation Department, if they are supervising you.
		
		
	
	
	If your parents sign waivers, it can speed up this process.
	The hearing will be set in about four to six weeks.&nbsp; You may have to pay for notification and/or publication.
	At the hearing, the Judge will listen to you, look at the forms you filled out and listen to anyone who objects.&nbsp;
	
		If the Judge feels you have met all the requirements and it is in your best interest, the petition will be approved.
	
	


&nbsp;

If your emancipation if approved by the Court:


	You can get a Certified Copy of Emancipation from the Clerk, for a fee.&nbsp;
	
		Take it to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get a new ID card to show you are emancipated.&nbsp;
		You will need this card to prove to a landlord and future employers that you are an emancipated minor.

Pro Se",Family Law,"BY DONNA BRYSON &nbsp;Associated Press &nbsp; June 10, 2016 &nbsp;Wichita Eagle

DENVER: &nbsp;After speaking to more than 100 people in four states who represented themselves in divorce, custody and child support cases, researchers are calling on lawyers to provide cheaper services and courts to offer more resources to those acting as their own attorneys.

More and more Americans are navigating the legal system on their own. Some jurisdictions report it's becoming the norm for at least one party to act on his or her own behalf in family court, often because trained help is out of financial reach.


The quality of justice can suffer, but things like technology and access to certain services help, according to a study released this week by Denver's Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System.


Fort Collins nurse Kerry Rayder, who was among the 128 people in Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon and Tennessee who were interviewed for the report, said she and her husband parted amicably in 2014, and neither had money to spare for a lawyer.

Rayder was confident her experience with medical documentation and her problem-solving personality would make filing for divorce manageable.

Instead, she spent so much time puzzling over ""legalese"" that her teenage daughter felt she was being neglected just as the dissolution of her family made her want her mother's attention.

""It's a much more difficult process than it has to be,"" Rayder told The Associated Press. She echoed the researchers' recommendation that legal language be simplified. She also was intrigued at a suggestion that attorneys coach people representing themselves at a fraction of their usual fees.

Natalie Anne Knowlton, who directed a family-focused project at the institute that prepared the ""Cases Without Counsel"" report, pointed to other attorney innovations.


Lawyers have, for example, left tasks such as filing documents to clients and billed only for questioning an estranged spouse or appearing in court, which can be particularly fraught for the uninitiated.


Last year, Knowlton's institute opened an out-of-court center based on an Australian model. For $4,500, center staff guide couples through divorces on which a retired judge signs off.

""Cases Without Counsel"" also cited a California example of a technological fix.

Earlier this year, the Orange County Superior Court launched an online portal that people can use to find forms, watch video instruction manuals or sign up for workshops on court procedure.

In 2013, the American Bar Association noted studies showing the number of people going to court without lawyers was increasing across the country, with between 60 and 90 percent of family law cases involving at least one party who had no legal representation.

Jason Drake, who also was interviewed for the Denver study, said the $5,000 he could afford in legal fees was only enough for the early stages of a divorce case that started in 2012. He finished on his own in 2014, informing himself in law libraries and online.

The 40-year-old machine technician from Orange, Massachusetts, estimated he spent four to six hours a day on his case, time he said he should have devoted to his two children during a stressful period. His former wife had a lawyer.

Fighting your own case is ""enormously devastating to both the wallet and the psyche,"" Drake told the AP.

The Denver researchers chose jurisdictions in Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon and Tennessee that offered diversity in geography and demographics, as well as in the range of court resources available to people representing themselves. They found subjects by recruiting at courthouses and scouring court records and sending notices to people who were involved in family cases.


The study brought important voices into a growing national conversation, said Jim Sandman, president of the nonprofit Legal Services Corporation (LSC).&nbsp;


LSC supports legal aid programs for low-income Americans. Sandman was not involved in the study.

Sandman noted judges who were interviewed by the Denver researchers spoke of seeing people fail to back up important points with evidence because they did not understand the rules.

""It affects the quality of justice,"" he said. ""It affects the integrity of the results.""

The Denver study mirrored an effort several years ago to determine how ordinary people were faring in Canadian courts. That research by Julie Macfarlane, a law professor at the University of Windsor, Ontario, led to the founding of Canada's National Self-Represented Litigants Project, which enables researchers, legal experts and others to share information and ideas.

In a telephone interview, Macfarlane said she can, for example, help link court officials with laymen to test whether online tools are effective and easy to use.

""That's the kind of thing that's really important going forward,"" Macfarlane said. ""It needs to keep involving the users.""

KIDS COUNT DATA: &nbsp;When it comes to the well-being of its&nbsp;children, Kansas took a tumble down the national rankings.

&nbsp;

WIBW 13 News&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;Lindsay Sax&nbsp;&nbsp;Jun 21, 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Things have gotten worse for children and youth in Kansas since 2015. &nbsp;‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs evident is that policy choices of the post-recession years have eroded the well-being of children and families in Kansas,"" said Annie McKay, president and CEO of Kansas Action for Children.


‚ÄúKansas struggles to keep afloat while other states swim laps around us.‚Äù


On June 21, Annie E. Casey Foundation released the 27th edition of its annual&nbsp;KIDS COUNT Data Book. The book ranks how each state takes care of its children, based on factors like economic well-being, education, health, and family and community.

In the 2016 edition, Kansas fell to 19th place overall. That's after coming in at 15th last year. That's the 3rd biggest drop in overall rankings on the list.

The Sunflower State also lost ground in two other categories: overall health and education. After ranking 13th in health in 2015, Kansas 24th place rank barely puts it in the top half of the country this year. In education, the state dropped eight slots from 12th to 20th.

Kansas managed to stand pat in the two other measures, ranking 9th and 24th in economic well-being and family and community, respectively.

According to the Data Book, 65 percent of Kansas fourth graders scored below proficient in reading, dropping Kansas from 13th overall to 30th nationally.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, instead of re-investing in important programs like early childhood education and expanding access to the safety net for Kansas‚Äô most vulnerable kids, policy makers weakened the safety net, repeatedly cut or swept funding for the Children‚Äôs Initiatives Fund, and diminished the state revenue stream, making Kansas families even more vulnerable and economically fragile,‚Äù McKay said. ‚ÄúKansas‚Äô overall decline is a direct reflection of those choices.‚Äù


The number of children living in high poverty areas has also increased.


From 2008 to 2014, the study says 65,000 or nine percent, of all Kansas children lived in high poverty areas. That‚Äôs compared to two percent in 2000.

The number of children living with a parent without full-time, year-round employment increased to 25 percent, dropping Kansas from 6th and 10th overall.

Kansas did make strides when it comes to children covered by health insurance. Since 2008, the number of children not covered by health insurance dropped from eight percent to five percent. The increase in covered children improved Kansas‚Äô rating from 23rd to 17th.

The 2016 Data Book is available online at&nbsp;www.aecf.org.

BY LAURA BAUER, KATY BERGEN AND MAR√Å ROSE WILLIAMS

The Kansas City Star&nbsp; October 23, 2016

She was 12, sitting in a dark auditorium, when a boy sitting next to her started rubbing her thigh without consent.

One woman endured constant lewd comments from male co-workers, only to be nicknamed ‚ÄúLittle Miss Tattle Tale‚Äù when she reported the harassment.

Many kept the stories of their assault and harassment a secret for decades.

Experiences like these ‚Äî shared by men and women in a&nbsp;survey conducted this week&nbsp;by The Star ‚Äî tell a pervasive story of sexual harassment and sexual assault. The nearly 300 responses show that inappropriate sexual behavior exists in the workplace, on college campuses, in bars, inside homes, between friends and acquaintances. Many said they never told anyone for fear they would be shamed or doubted.

But that, advocates say, could be a crucial step closer to changing.

In June, a woman who was sexually assaulted at Stanford University&nbsp;published a gut-wrenching letter&nbsp;about her experience. Then, two weeks ago, a tape surfaced of a&nbsp;2005 conversation&nbsp;between presidential candidate Donald Trump and then-‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù co-host Billy Bush.

That exchange prompted survivors across the country to step out of the shadows and share their experiences ‚Äî many for the first time ‚Äî on social media.

Responding to a challenge from a Canadian author, women and men wrote about their ‚Äúfirst assaults‚Äù on Twitter under&nbsp;#notokay. Roughly 10 million people have since posted their stories or responded to the tweet.

‚ÄúPeople are emboldened when they don‚Äôt have to say things face to face,‚Äù said Jill Patterson, a former prosecutor for sexual and domestic violence in southwest Missouri‚Äôs Greene County. ‚ÄúAnd when they see others who are going through the same thing, people feel courage.&nbsp;‚Ä¶ We are tearing down the isolation because there is so much conversation, so many are coming forward, and there is strength in numbers.‚Äù

The support has been ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs grace‚Äù for Maggie, a Kansas City woman who was raped three decades ago.

‚ÄúTo see others speaking out about it, that brings more comfort to me than anything else in the world. Nothing will make it OK, but if others are rallying around it, I mean, thank you. Thank you very much.‚Äù

Among the throng of #notokay tweets, a Kansas City-area woman shared her story on Oct. 8, the day after the Trump tape surfaced.

‚ÄúFamily friend tells me ‚ÄòYou shouldn‚Äôt LET me do this‚Äô as he put his hand down my pants. I was 12. Made me think it was my fault.‚Äù

The impact isn‚Äôt just felt on social media. Kansas City‚Äôs&nbsp;Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault&nbsp;(MOCSA) has seen the number of calls to the crisis line double in the past two weeks. And last weekend, 23 people went to hospitals in the six-county area for sexual assault exams. That‚Äôs twice the number for a typical weekend.

‚ÄúThis is the first time in my career that I really felt that this has reached its tipping point,‚Äù said Julie Donelon, MOCSA‚Äôs president and CEO. ‚ÄúThis conversation isn‚Äôt going to die down. Survivors aren‚Äôt going to let that happen. Advocates aren‚Äôt going to let that happen.

‚ÄúPeople are talking about this issue and realize we have a role in changing the narrative.‚Äù

‚ÄòNot my fault‚Äô

For Andrea, a 32-year-old who lives in mid-Missouri, the narrative was about blame.

She woke up in the bedroom with a man she didn‚Äôt know on top of her. And for 10 years, she didn‚Äôt tell anyone. She was 21 and had been drinking when the incident occurred after she laid down in a spare bedroom during a party with friends. For years, she carried a sense of responsibility for the assault because she had been drinking.

‚ÄúThe older I get and the more confident I become in myself, I realized that it was not my fault,‚Äù Andrea told The Star. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt matter how much I was drinking. It didn‚Äôt matter how much my friends were drinking. It was nobody‚Äôs fault but the person who tried to do something he shouldn‚Äôt have done.‚Äù

Andrea says she believes she would react differently if the same thing happened to her today and would report it to authorities. She attributes that partly to growing up and partly to increased dialogue about sexual assault. She hopes that dialogue continues and helps educate young people about these issues.

‚ÄúI think the conversation needs to start early about what appropriate boundaries are,‚Äù Andrea said. ‚ÄúWhat are appropriate ways to talk about men and about women?‚Äù


October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month


Margaret Veglahn of Prairie Village has been going to Kansas City-area schools for the past year to help educate young people and change the conversation.

Just 14, Margaret is a peer educator for&nbsp;Safehome, a Johnson County domestic violence agency. She and other volunteers talk to young people and perform skits about everything from bullying and teen dating to sexual harassment and assault.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm seeing the girls and boys who are victims,‚Äù Margaret said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre asking us, ‚ÄòHow do I protect myself?‚Äô&nbsp;‚Äù

The idea, she said, is to stop the cycle of mistreatment and abuse. That‚Äôs why the Trump tape made her so angry. The high school student worried about the impact his words could have.

‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt be taught that a ‚Äòstar‚Äô can treat women however they want to,‚Äù Margaret wrote on Facebook. ‚ÄúEleven-year-old girls ask me what they did wrong that resulted in their own sexual assault. The world has told them THEY need to change. Me, a 14-year-old, should not have to hug them and tell them they did nothing wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄòIt was validating‚Äô

Janie M. saw The Star‚Äôs survey after a Facebook friend shared it and revealed she had been date-raped. That‚Äôs when Janie felt compelled to speak out about her assault.

She was 18 and pregnant when her mother took her to a psychologist to talk about what she was going through. Instead, the doctor asked her personal questions about her pregnancy and how her body had changed. Then he removed her bra and began touching and examining her breasts. This is the first time Janie has told her story publicly.

‚ÄúI want people to be aware that these things really do happen,‚Äù Janie told the newspaper after completing the survey. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should have to keep quiet about that. Should a woman have to go through that all her life just to be able to go to work or make a living or go to a doctor?‚Äù

She also hopes sharing her story sheds light on how little action is often taken after women report assault. After she left the psychologist‚Äôs office, she told her mother what happened. Distraught, her mother barged into the office and demanded an explanation. The family was told that the psychologist was a ‚Äúgood doctor‚Äù with zero complaints. No one called police.

‚ÄúNothing ever happened,‚Äù Janie said. ‚ÄúWho do you turn to? How do you get it to stop?‚Äù

At the University of Kansas, a fed-up Emma Halling organized a student forum.

Two years ago, Halling got angry after a male student received what she thought was a mild punishment for sexually assaulting a female on campus.

Halling, now a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, used Facebook to organize a student forum and push a referendum asking the university to do more to address sexual assault.

‚ÄúI think social media made it easy to accumulate more people with shared experience,‚Äù Halling, 24, said. ‚ÄúPeople were saying, ‚ÄòI am pissed and I know you are pissed too.‚Äô‚Äù

As Halling addressed the campus forum where hundreds showed up, she found herself telling her own story of being sexually assaulted by a neighbor when she was 15 years old ‚Äî something she hadn‚Äôt ever spoken of in public.

Then, one after another, nearly a dozen women approached the podium and shared their stories of sexual abuse and harassment.

‚ÄúFor me it was validating,‚Äù Halling said. ‚ÄúI had been trying to organize people to talk about sexual assaults on college campuses for about a year. This proved I hadn‚Äôt been just yelling down an empty hallway.

‚ÄúIt is undeniable. This is a movement.‚Äù

‚ÄòWithout shame‚Äô

Annette Jenkins, a 27-year-old manager of a Columbia law firm, knew her abuser from church.

‚ÄúHe was 89 years old, nice, the sweet grandfather figure who always had a pocket full of peppermints,‚Äù Jenkins said.

One summer morning when she was 13, Annette and her younger brother were home alone when someone knocked on the front door. The man, a church deacon, had never been to her home before but there he was.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know why he was there,‚Äù Jenkins recalled. ‚ÄúI stepped outside to talk with him.‚Äù She hugged him as a greeting.

Jenkins, who later told a sheriff‚Äôs deputy what happened, said the man put his hand under her shirt and touched her. She pushed his hand away and he tried to slide his hand inside her shorts.

‚ÄúI crossed my legs to stop him. He stopped and said, ‚ÄòYou didn‚Äôt like that did you?‚Äô I said no and the tears just came. I showered for 45 minutes after. I could smell him on me.‚Äù

She called her mom and told her father, the town prosecutor. But Jenkins never testified against the man. ‚ÄúSomething I regret to this day.‚Äù She said he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge.

Jenkins had family support. But ‚Äúchurchgoers sided with him,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople were saying he would never do that, what did she do?‚Äù

She shared her story through The Star survey because, ‚ÄúI would like to see justice for those too scared to talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are getting tired of being harassed, we are getting tired of hearing, ‚Äòoh boys will be boys,‚Äô&nbsp;‚Äù Jenkins said.

Maggie, a Kansas City woman, held her secret close for 30 years. A select few, including her brother and mother, knew what had happened to her in high school.

They knew that her brother‚Äôs friend had raped her and that she had carried the pain and shame with her every day since. But to most of the world, it was hidden.

Then, on a Sunday in June, she saw a post on Twitter about the sexual assault at Stanford. The survivor had shared the letter she read in court to her attacker, an athlete who assaulted her when she was unconscious.

Maggie read the words and sobbed. So much of the woman‚Äôs story and pain sounded like her own.

‚ÄúI ran upstairs, grabbed my laptop and started writing my story,‚Äù she said.

A month later, she told her father. And in late August, she invited 20 of the women closest to her for a ‚ÄúSurvive &amp; Thrive‚Äù gathering. Her mom was there when Maggie told the group what had happened three decades before. She told them she was a survivor.

‚ÄúI never slept so well as I did after that,‚Äù Maggie said.

She feels now is the time to keep the issues of rape culture and rape prevention out front and public. Get people talking about it. Let people know the narrative can change. It has to.

‚ÄúIf we consistently have the dialogue that yes means yes and everything else means no, then we will be making progress, meaningful progress,‚Äù Maggie said. ‚ÄúI think this is a moment in time we need to seize.

‚ÄúMaybe we won‚Äôt end rape,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut maybe we will empower victims to come forward without shame.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Half of Kansas kids now qualify for free- and reduced-price lunches during the school year. But only about 7 percent of those kids participate in summer food programs that keep them fed when school is out, according to a presentation July 17 at the 2015 Kansas Conference on Poverty.

The session on ‚ÄúStrategies to End Hunger in Kansas‚Äù was led by Hilary Gee, a health policy analyst for the Topeka nonprofit Kansas Action for Children, and Rebekah Gaston, the childhood hunger initiative director for Kansas Appleseed, a legal group that advocates on behalf of children.

They said Kansas ranks 50th out of all states and the District of Columbia ‚Äî ahead of only Oklahoma ‚Äî in summer food program participation and not much better in other child nutrition areas.

‚ÄúKansas has pretty low participation in a number of federal nutrition programs,‚Äù Gee said. Twenty percent of Kansas kids are considered ‚Äúfood insecure,‚Äù according to Gee and Gaston. Yet the state ranks 46th in participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and 34th in school breakfast participation, with 54 percent of those eligible not receiving it.

After the Legislature voted in June to increase the state sales tax, most Kansans also now pay the nation‚Äôs highest sales tax on food.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a good distinction,‚Äù Gee said. Gaston and Gee said Kansas doesn‚Äôt need new government programs to solve hunger problems. ‚ÄúAll of these programs we‚Äôre going to talk about are programs that already exist,‚Äù Gaston said. ‚ÄúWe just need to start using them better in Kansas.‚Äù

The summer food program‚Äôs low rate of usage, for example, is partly a matter of access.

Thirty-five of the state‚Äôs 105 counties, including all of northwest Kansas, currently have no sites for summer meals. Gaston said that‚Äôs improving a bit year-to-year, but large swaths still struggle with the logistics of transporting far-flung students to a central site for lunch in the summer. ‚ÄúWe know in Kansas we have a lot of frontier and rural counties, especially in western Kansas,‚Äù Gaston said.

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs been a huge challenge.‚Äù Some suggestions for improving participation in the summer program were to create county-level task forces, start a site or volunteer to help serve or supervise at a site.

Gaston said Westminster Presbyterian‚Äôs summer program in Topeka is a model to follow.

Gee said state-level changes to SNAP that restricted eligibility and cut outreach programs will lead to 1,500 Kansans losing food benefits this fiscal year and 3,000 next year, increasing pressure on local food banks.

She encouraged conference attendees to get involved in state politics. Gov. Sam Brownback‚Äôs administration has said the changes are intended to encourage work rather than reliance on government assistance.

Gaston said the federal Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 has become a political lightning rod because of its association with first lady Michelle Obama, but it is largely working in providing healthier lunches for young students. She noted that a group of retired U.S. military generals recently released a report encouraging lawmakers to stick with the program, as a hedge against childhood obesity rates that disqualify a significant percentage of Americans from military service.

&nbsp;Background

Prior to 1987, most funding for homeless programs was handled at the local level. With pressure on Congress to address rising problems with homelessness, Congress approved the&nbsp;McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, under which the Continuum of Care Programs (Supportive Housing Program, Shelter Plus Care Program, and Permanent Housing Program) provide funding for entities that serve the homeless population.

Since 1994, the&nbsp;U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)&nbsp;has encouraged communities to address the problems of housing and homelessness in a coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic fashion. With input from practitioners throughout the country, HUD introduced the Continuum of Care concept to support communities in this effort. This concept is designed to help communities develop the capacity to envision, organize, and plan comprehensive and long-term solutions to addressing the problem of homelessness in their community.

Local CoC Activities

The Topeka-Shawnee County CoC tracks and manages the homeless community in the Topeka area. One of most important activities entrusted to all CoCs is the annual count of the homeless population and an annual enumeration of emergency systems, support services, transitional housing units, and beds that make up the homeless assistance systems. These counts provide an overview of the state of homelessness in a CoC, and offer the information necessary to redirect services, funding, and resources as necessary. The CoC also manages these services, offering both prevention strategies and homeless assistance programs to assist those at-risk of or experiencing homelessness.

Members of the Topeka-Shawnee County CoC include:

Kansas Legal Services

City of Topeka ShelterPlusCare

Communty Action

Community Resources Council

Valeo Behavioral Health Care

&nbsp;

The Topeka-Shawnee County Homeless Task Force helps monitor the activities and outcomes of the CoC. &nbsp;Members of the Homeless Task Force include dozens of social service agencies, government entities, and medical and mental health providers. Members include but are not limited to:

Huston, MD, MPH, Susan Zinn, JD, and Sylvia Leal-Castanon, MDYou are a pediatrician, halfway through a busy morning clinic. You walk into an exam room to see 9-year-old Sarah, whose asthma you have treated for years, and her mother. Initially, Sarah‚Äôs health was very unstable, requiring numerous hospitalizations. By working closely with her family, you were able to get her asthma under control.In the past 6 months, however, Sarah has had three emergency department visits and two hospitalizations for asthma. You are confident that the family is compliant with the treatment plan, and your medical management has been comprehensive: allergy testing, pulmonary function tests, asthma education classes, appropriate medications‚Äîand yet, Sarah‚Äôs asthma is not controlled. You dig deeper and identify several problems. First, Sarah and her family rent an apartment that is infested with cockroaches. The family keeps their apartment meticulously but there is trash in the hallways, and an often-overfilled dumpster sits against the outside wall. There is also a water leak from the apartment above theirs that has led to mold growth on one wall. Sarah‚Äôs mother has tried repeatedly to get the landlord to address these problems, to no avail.A second problem is that Sarah has lost her Medicaid. Her mother submitted the renewal application 2 months ago but has not heard back. The family is unable to purchase Sarah‚Äôs medications. Finally, Sarah‚Äôs school has threatened to take her family to court because of excessive school absences this year. In this case, you realize that fixing Sarah‚Äôs problems will take a lot more than the latest and best asthma medications. Sarah needs a specialist‚Äînot a pulmonologist or allergist, but a lawyer. If you work with a medical-legal partnership (MLP), Sarah and her mother can walk right down your hallway and meet with a lawyer who can address these problems.The National Center for Medical-Legal Partnership defines MLP asa health care and legal services delivery model that aims to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable individuals, children and families by integrating legal assistance into the medical setting. MLPs address social determinants of health and seek to eliminate barriers to health care in order to help vulnerable populations meet their basic needs and stay healthy [1].The first MLP was developed by Barry Zuckerman, MD, at Boston Medical Center in 1993, and the model is used in 225 hospitals and health centers in 38 states. In 2010, more than 13,000 individuals and families received legal assistance through MLPs, and more than 10,000 health care professionals received training on the MLP model. MLP has been endorsed by the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association [2, 3].MLPs focus on three key activities. First, they provide legal assistance in the health care setting. Legal professionals meet with families to identify and address those circumstances affecting their health that are amenable to legal intervention. Second, MLPs work to transform health care practice by educating health care professionals about the significance of social determinants of health. Third, MLPs work toward policy change by addressing local, state, and federal laws and regulations that can stand in the way of maintaining good health.As physicians, accurately diagnosing our patients‚Äô problems and providing the latest evidence-based management of their physical problems can seem challenging enough. We must go deeper, however, to better understand the underlying causes of our patients‚Äô illnesses and the reasons why they sometimes do not respond to our medications. Often the answer is found by taking a detailed social history.Increasing attention is being paid to the social determinants of illness. A 2009 review in&nbsp;Pediatrics&nbsp;emphasized the strong link between problems in the social and physical environments and the risk for childhood asthma [4]. There is also evidence that the origins of adult conditions can be traced back to childhood [5]‚Äîresearchers have found strong associations between early childhood adverse experiences and environments and adult diseases such as coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, alcoholism, depression, and drug abuse. Few physicians make house calls anymore, so we must delve deeper in our history taking to fully understand the circumstances that may be influencing our patients‚Äô health. It is also important for us to develop collaborative relationships with other professionals in our community. Typically, these other professionals will be in the health care field, but sometimes what our patients really need is a lawyer.According to a 2009 report from the Legal Services Corporation, the average low-income household in the United States had 1.3-3.0 legal needs per year [6]. These needs included problems related to housing, consumer protection, family law, employment, health care, and government benefits. Typically, legal assistance was received for fewer than 20 percent of these problems.Unsafe housing conditions and inappropriate denials of government benefits are common examples of legal problems that can directly affect the health of our patients. Through direct access to legal advice while in the hospital or clinic, our patients get the assistance they need. Data show that MLPs can increase access to health care and improve the patient‚Äôs and family‚Äôs sense of well-being [7]. Assistance with benefit denials can also significantly improve reimbursement to health care facilities, which can help defray the cost of the program [8].So let‚Äôs get back to Sarah. Her mother receives legal assistance from the MLP in your clinic. Two telephone calls from the MLP lawyer are enough to get the landlord to address the cockroach and mold problem and to get Sarah‚Äôs Medicaid reinstated. The lawyer then goes with the mother to Sarah‚Äôs school. School personnel agree to accept Sarah‚Äôs medically excused absences and to work with her mother to help Sarah catch up on school work that she missed. Sarah‚Äôs mother is ecstatic and Sarah‚Äôs asthma management gets back on track.ReferencesNational Center for Medical-Legal Partnership. About us. http://www.medical-legalpartnership.org/about-us.

Examples of qualifying life events are: moving to a new state, certain changes in your income (like changing jobs), and changes in your family size (for example, if you marry, divorce, or have a baby), etc.

370,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1923,Gallup survey shows Kansas as lone state with rising uninsured rate,Medicaid,"Obamacare
uninsured",Health,"By&nbsp;DAN MARGOLIES&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heartland Health Monitor

&nbsp;

Gallup is out with a&nbsp;new poll&nbsp;showing falling uninsured rates in every state but one: Kansas.

Although not statistically significant, the Sunflower State‚Äôs 1.9 point increase makes it the only state in the country to witness an uptick.

In 2013, 12.5 percent of the state‚Äôs residents lacked health insurance; in 2014, that percentage had risen to 14.4 percent, according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index results released Tuesday.

Kansas has no Medicaid expansion

Kansas, of course, is one of more than 30 states that opted not to set up its own state exchange, or marketplace, under Obamacare. And it‚Äôs one of 22 states that have declined to expand Medicaid.

As Gallup notes, of the 11 states with the greatest reductions, 10 both expanded Medicaid and set up a state-based exchange. Only Montana, tied for 10th, did not.

Missouri, which also did not establish its own exchange or expand Medicaid, saw its uninsured rate drop from 15.2 percent to 13.4 percent, a 1.8 point drop, according to Gallup.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Kansas officials are skeptical

Some Kansas officials were skeptical back in August when the last Gallup results were released. Those results showed the adult uninsured rate in Kansas had risen by a whopping 5.1 percentage points in mid-2014.

They noted that, while Kansas didn‚Äôt expand Medicaid eligibility, enrollment had increased because of the so-called woodwork effect ‚Äì previously eligible people signing up as a result of the publicity about getting health insurance.

Linda Sheppard, a senior policy analyst at the Kansas Health Institute in Topeka and a former director of health care policy at the Kansas Insurance Department, is among those who remain skeptical of the latest results.

‚ÄúWe had new people in the marketplace, several thousand people were added to the Medicaid rolls, and we knew that the (insurance) companies had been allowed to maintain those transitional plans in place and a large number of people kept those plans,‚Äù she says.

She allows, however, that the uninsured rate could have gone up, noting that there are no data on people who have dropped coverage.

‚ÄúIf this is happening for economic reasons because there are, for example, small employers who have discontinued offering their employees coverage, certainly there would definitely be people who lost coverage,‚Äù Sheppard says.

‚ÄúAnd maybe at the time that these (Gallup) phone calls were made, they had not gotten a new job or had missed the opportunity to go onto the marketplace or had chosen not to do that.‚Äù

Missouri uninsured rate dropped with start of Obamacare

While the decrease in Missouri‚Äôs uninsured rate was within the poll‚Äôs margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent, Missouri Hospital Association spokesman David Dillon attributed the drop squarely to Obamacare.

‚ÄúLast year we saw over 150,000 Missourians get coverage through the federal marketplace. This year the number is anticipated to be 250,000. That is a big chunk of the uninsured in this area,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúThere were between 800,000 and 900,000 uninsured (in Missouri) before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, and now we‚Äôre seeing the marketplace as an effective tool in helping subsidize lower income people who haven‚Äôt been able historically to afford to buy insurance themselves, or who were ineligible for Medicaid because Missouri‚Äôs rate for Medicaid is very low.‚Äù

In Missouri, Medicaid eligibility for the non-disabled is limited to non-elderly adults with dependent children whose incomes don‚Äôt exceed 19 percent of the federal poverty level. In Kansas, Medicaid eligibility is limited to non-elderly adults who make no more than 32 percent of the federal poverty level.

About 300,000 low-income Missourians would gain coverage if Medicaid eligibility were expanded to 138 percent of the poverty level, as envisioned under Obamacare. In Kansas, expansion would extend coverage to an estimated 151,000 people.

States that expanded Medicaid saw uninsured rates drop

Gallup notes that states that chose to expand Medicaid and establish their own exchanges witnessed significantly greater drops in their uninsured rates than states that did neither.

Nationwide, the uninsured rate fell 3.5 points, to 13.8 percent from 17.3 percent, between 2013 and 2014, Gallup says ‚Äì the lowest point in seven years. Reducing the number of people without health insurance was one of the chief aims of the Affordable Care Act ‚Äì and by that yardstick, despite its continuing unpopularity as measured by polls, it appears to be succeeding.

Arkansas and Kentucky recorded the biggest drops, according to Gallup ‚Äì 11.1 points and 9.8 points, respectively. And for the seventh straight year, Texas had the highest uninsured rate at 24.4 percent. That‚Äôs actually lower than the 27 percent it had in 2013 and the lowest rate to date for Texas, according to Gallup.

The Gallup results were based on phone interviews with a random sample of 178,072 adults in 2013 and 176,702 adults in 2014.

The Kansas Department of Children and Families says a computer glitch resulted in thousands of Kansans receiving letters telling them in error that their Medicaid coverage had been cancelled.

&nbsp;

By&nbsp;Peter Hancock&nbsp; &nbsp; Lawrence Journal World

July 31, 2015

&nbsp;

TOPEKA&nbsp;‚Äî The Kansas Department of Children and Families said this week that a computer glitch resulted in thousands of Kansans, including many elderly and disabled individuals, receiving letters telling them in error that their Medicaid coverage had been canceled.

DCF spokeswoman Theresa Freed said the error stemmed from the fact that the department is switching over to a new computer system that manages Medicaid eligibility applications, replacing a ""legacy"" computer system that has been in use since the early 1980s.

""The letters were sent in error,"" she said. ""However, within a week, everyone who received the initial letter will have a new letter or an accurate report of their account.""

Medicaid is a health insurance program for the poor. It is managed by state governments but it is jointly funded with state and federal dollars. In Kansas, the federal government pays about 60 percent of the cost.

Eligibility is based largely on income and the number of people in the household. There are different eligibility requirements for children, parents, elderly and disabled individuals.

Each year a person receives coverage, the state routinely asks for verification of the person's current income and other household information to determine if he or she is still eligible.

Whenever a Medicaid recipient, or that person's family or caretaker, fails to respond to the request for updated information, the person is typically dropped from the program. DCF then sends a letter notifying the person of the action.

People who are dropped can be readmitted once they provide the required information.

Freed said that some of the cancellation letters mailed out in July were legitimate, and those individuals or families need to contact DCF to be reinstated. She said those letters were mailed in envelopes that have a DCF logo on them, but the letters sent by mistake had no such logo.

She also said the computer glitch only caused letters to be generated. None of those individuals who still qualify for Medicaid were taken off the Medicaid rolls or had their benefits suspended.

Peggy Wallert, director of community relations and development for Cottonwood Inc., of Lawrence, an agency that serves people with developmental disabilities, said some of its clients had received the letters.

""We did have families who received the letter, but because we had some advance warning that it was a mistake, we were able to notify those families, which we did,"" Wallert said.

Angela DeRocha, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, said some individuals in nursing homes also received the mistaken letters.

""We got a few calls,"" she said. ""I suspect DCF got the vast majority of them. But once we reassured them that this was not happening, they were good with that. It's unfortunate that this happened.""

Freed said that everyone who received one of the mistaken letters will have received a follow-up letter explaining the error by the end of next week.

440,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/2046,Wichita:  Even applying for Medicaid can be an ordeal in Kansas,Poverty,Medicaid,Health,"Applying for Medicaid is now more difficult, especially for those who don‚Äôt have access to a computer.


&nbsp;

PHILLIP BROWNLEE &nbsp; &nbsp;Eagle Editorial Board &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wichita Eagle, May 26, 2016

Not only can it take months for the Brownback administration to process and approve Medicaid applications, but even applying for Medicaid can be an ordeal. No wonder there has been a drop in the number of Medicaid beneficiaries in Kansas.

The state‚Äôs&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;new online application system and reorganized processing clearinghouse were supposed to make enrolling in Medicaid faster and easier. The opposite happened.

In some cases, it has taken up to five months to approve applications, which has caused financial hardship on nursing homes and endangered the health of some patients. Also, thousands of poor Kansans have mistakenly been denied Medicaid coverage because of glitches in the system, the Kansas Health Institute News Service&nbsp;reported.

What‚Äôs more, applying for Medicaid is now more difficult, especially for those who don‚Äôt have access to a computer. Obtaining a paper application can be a challenge, and calling to the state‚Äôs telephone hotline can result in lengthy holds, the Topeka Capital-Journal&nbsp;reported. The Brownback administration also made the application more complicated, with more documentation requirements.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a consumer and you‚Äôre trying to navigate this ‚Äì if you‚Äôre frail, if you‚Äôve got a head injury, if you‚Äôve got any cognitive challenges, if you have to physically maneuver around in a wheelchair or a walker ‚Äì how hard have we made this system for people at this point?‚Äù asked Mitzi McFatrich, director of Kansas Advocates for Better Care.

The delays and bureaucratic barriers may be a factor in why the number of Kansans on Medicaid has decreased, even though poverty rates haven‚Äôt changed significantly. In February 2015, there were 412,320 Medicaid beneficiaries in Kansas. This past February (the most recent data available), the total was 402,932.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs pretty clear those structural changes are leading to those people not being able to come into the system who clearly need it,‚Äù Sean Gatewood with the KanCare Advocates Network told the Capital-Journal.

Hospitals and other providers also have complained about slow payments from the private insurance companies that manage the state‚Äôs Medicaid program. And the state floated anidea&nbsp;this week to change how it pays providers and reduce the number of providers in some areas.

Meanwhile, Gov. Sam Brownback continues to refuse to allow a federal expansion of Medicaid, which is keeping about 150,000 additional Kansans from receiving health insurance coverage. Last week he&nbsp;announced&nbsp;reimbursement cuts to Medicaid providers, which could cause more physicians and dentists to stop seeing Medicaid patients.

It seems almost as if the Brownback administration wants Medicaid to fail.

These clinics were held each year during the months of November, January and March. For the past two years, the attorneys of Kansas Legal Services and approximately 20 additional volunteer attorneys answered legal questions for approximately 100 residents at the homeless shelters. The questions ranged from simple child support and traffic issues to complex employment issues. In addition to advising clients, some private attorneys who assisted at the clinics took on long-term commitments to assist clients pro bono.The attorneys who participated in the clinics were able to assist a population who too often feelthat they are living on the fringe of society and do not matter. Further, due to their living and employment situations, this population does not have easy access to assistance provided by most attorneys. True justice mandates assistance not only to those who can pay for it, but also to those on the margins of society. Lack of income does not equate to a lack of legal problems, but instead is a barrier to access to the courts and adequate solutions to those problems. At the homeless clinics over the past two winters, there were a number of dedicated legal professionals who offered their services to those who were afraid or unable to access services in the usual fashion. While the service provided is free to the homeless, the staff of Kansas Legal Services and the volunteers are richly paid with the satisfaction that they are making a difference and are living proof that attorneys do care and can make a difference.This year, AECH and the homeless community are shifting the model in which they provide services to the homeless. After many years of planning and dreaming, Open Door Ministries has opened the Homeless Resource Center at 402 &nbsp;E. Second, Wichita, Kansas, to provide all the services necessary to prevent homelessness. &nbsp;The Homeless Resource Center is the only comprehensive day assistance center for homeless in Wichita. The center provides case management, a daily meal, access to showers, laundry facilities, small storage, a telephone with message board, and mail service. In addition, The Safety Net and Transitional Housing programs provide permanent supportive housing and are provided in collaboration with COMCARE of Sedgwick County Homeless Services Division and Mennonite Housing. These programs address the needs of a growing demographic by providing an apartment for single persons who are chronically homeless and disabled with a mental illness. Finally, The Vision Quest program is a home-based outreach program designed to prevent homelessness and help families break out &nbsp;of the cycle of poverty. Case management is provided to teach budgeting, life skills, and job readiness and training. The two case managers make home visits as often as needed to assist the family to develop &nbsp;a work plan with full-time employment and long-term self-sufficiency as the goals.Because Open Door Ministries has opened the Homeless Resource Center, Kansas Legal Services has modified its plan for outreach among&nbsp;the homeless population.&nbsp;Kansas Legal Services is provided office space to meet with clients at the Homeless Resource Center. The service has been utilized by many of the clients of Open Door over the past few months. Each week on Tuesday and Thursday from 10 to 11 a.m., attorneys and paralegals provide service and answer questions that range from employment issues to Social Security disability and VA pensions.Kansas Legal Services cannot provide legal assistance to the growing homeless population alone. &nbsp;We need help. Volunteer attorneys are very much needed. In addition to the homeless outreach, Kansas Legal Services will continue to provide clinics to victims of domestic violence. These occur quarterly during evenings through the year.If you are an attorney and would like to help or know of an attorney who would be interested in providing assistance in either program, please email sullivanr@klsinc.org or call (316) 290-8208. With your assistance we can show this community that society does care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

371,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1925,Fair housing rights to protect you under the law,Housing,,Housing,"What is the Fair Housing Act?



The federal&nbsp;Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the&nbsp;Civil Rights&nbsp;Act of 1968, was intended to protect the buyer/renter of a dwelling from seller/landlord discrimination.&nbsp;The law was the result of a&nbsp;civil rights&nbsp;campaign against&nbsp;housing discrimination in the United States. It was approved, at the urging of&nbsp;President&nbsp;Lyndon B. Johnson, only one week after the&nbsp;assassination&nbsp;of&nbsp;Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Act is enforced by the&nbsp;United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

HUD examines complaints of housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, or familial status. At no cost to you, HUD will explore the complaint and try to resolve the matter with both parties. The process to file a complaint is covered below.

NOTE:&nbsp;If you want to learn more about your rights as a renter in Kansas, read this Kansas&nbsp;Tenant&nbsp;Handbook. It was originally published by the Kansas agency&nbsp;Housing and Credit Counseling, Inc. (HCCI), which helps people in Kansas with a variety of consumer issues.

What Housing Is Covered?

The Fair Housing Act covers most housing. In some cases, the Act exempts owner-occupied buildings with no more than four units, single-family housing sold or rented without a broker, and housing operated by organizations and private clubs that limit occupancy to members.

What Is Prohibited?

In the Sale and Rental of Housing:&nbsp;No one may take any of the following actions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap:


	Refuse to rent or sell housing
	Refuse to bargain for housing
	Make housing unavailable
	Deny a dwelling
	Set different terms, conditions or privileges for sale or rental of a dwelling
	Provide different housing services or facilities
	Falsely deny that housing is open for inspection, sale, or rental
	For profit, persuade owners to sell or rent (blockbusting) or
	Deny anyone access to or membership in a facility or service (such as a multiple listing service) related to the sale or rental of housing.


In&nbsp;Mortgage&nbsp;Lending:&nbsp;No one may take any of the following actions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap (disability):


	Refuse to make a&nbsp;mortgage&nbsp;loan
	Refuse to give info about loans
	Impose different terms or conditions on a loan, such as different interest rates, points, or fees
	Discriminate in appraising property
	Refuse to buy a loan or
	Set different terms or conditions for purchasing a loan.


In Addition:&nbsp;It is illegal for anyone to:


	Threaten, coerce, bully or interfere with anyone applying a fair housing right or assisting others who exercise that right
	Advertise or make any statement that indicates a cap or preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap. This bar against discriminatory advertising applies to single-family and owner-occupied housing that is otherwise exempt from the Fair Housing Act.


Additional Protection if You Have a Disability

If you or someone connected with you:


	Have a physical or mental disability (including hearing, mobility and visual impairments, chronic alcoholism, chronic mental illness, AIDS, AIDS Related Complex and mental retardation) that greatly limits one or more major life activities
	Have a record of such a disability or
	Are regarded as having such a disability


Your&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;may not:


	Refuse to let you make realistic changes to your dwelling or common use areas, at your expense, if needed for the disabled person to use the housing. (Where rational, the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;may permit changes only if you agree to restore the property to its original condition when you move.)
	Refuse to make sensible variations in rules, policies, practices or services if needed for the disabled person to use the housing.


Example:&nbsp;A building with a ‚Äòno pets‚Äô policy must allow a visually impaired&nbsp;tenant&nbsp;to keep a guide dog.

Example:&nbsp;Let‚Äôs say an apartment complex offers tenants ample, unassigned parking. They must honor a bid from a mobility-impaired&nbsp;tenant&nbsp;for a reserved space near her apartment if it is needed to assure that she can have access to her apartment.

However, housing need not be made vacant to a person who is a direct threat to the health or safety of others or who now uses illegal drugs.

Requirements for New Buildings

In buildings that were ready for first use after March 13, 1991, and have an elevator and four or more units:


	Public and common areas must be handy to persons with disabilities
	Doors and hallways must be wide enough for wheelchairs
	All units must have:
	
		An accessible route into and through the unit
		Handy light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls
		Reinforced bathroom walls to allow later fitting of grab bars and
		Kitchens and bathrooms that can be used by people in wheelchairs.
	
	


If a building with four or more units has no elevator and were ready for first use after March 13, 1991, these standards apply to ground floor units.

These must-haves for new buildings do not replace any more stringent standards in State or local law.

Housing Opportunities for Families

Unless a building or community makes the grade as housing for older persons, it may not discriminate based on familial status. That is, it may not discriminate against families in which one or more children under 18 live with:


	A parent
	A person who has&nbsp;legal custody&nbsp;of the child or children or
	The designee of the parent or legal custodian, with the parent or custodian's written permission.


Familial status protection also applies to pregnant women and anyone securing&nbsp;legal custody&nbsp;of a child under 18.

Exemption: Housing for older persons is exempt from the ban against familial status discrimination if:


	The HUD Secretary has decided that it is specially designed for and occupied by elderly persons under a Federal, State or local government program or
	It is occupied solely by persons who are 62 or older or
	It houses at least one person who is 55 or older in at least 80 percent of the occupied units. It must also adhere to a policy that demonstrates an intent to house persons who are 55 or older.


A transition period permits residents on or before September 13, 1988, to continue living in the housing, regardless of their age, without interfering with the exemption.

If you believe your rights have been violated‚Ä¶.



The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or a Kansas or local fair housing agency is ready to help you file a complaint.

What to Tell HUD

	IF it does have furniture, the landlord cannot ask for more than one and one half month‚Äôs rent
	


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Unit WITH furniture -&gt; maximum 1+1/2 month‚Äôs rent)

A landlord may also ask for a pet deposit, which cannot be more than half of 1 month‚Äôs rent.

How can you get your security deposit back?

Your landlord MUST return your security deposit, UNLESS:


	You owe back rent
	You did not leave the unit as clean as it was when you moved in
	There was damage to the unit that happened while you were renting it
	
		IF the damage is normal wear and tear you would expect to see, like fading paint, then the landlord cannot deduct ANYTHING from your security deposit.
		IF the damage is more than ordinary wear and tear, like a hole in a wall, the landlord can take out the amount it would cost to return the unit to how it was when you moved in. The rest of the security deposit not spent on cleaning or repairing the unit HAS to be returned to you.
	
	


Does the landlord have a deadline to return my security deposit?

YES: In Kansas, the landlord must mail your security deposit to you within 30 days.


	IF you don‚Äôt get your deposit by that deadline, write your landlord a letter asking for the return of your deposit.
	IF you still do not get your deposit back, you may have to sue in Small Claims Court.

What is a move-in inspection?

A move-in inspection takes place within 5 days after your&nbsp;lease&nbsp;starts.

This is when you and the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;walk through the property and write down any damages that you see.


	After you and the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;finish looking at the property:
	
		Both of you will sign the list of damages or things the landlord says will be fixed. (If the walls are marked-up or dirty, write that down. If a light doesn‚Äôt work, write that down. If the landlord promises to fix something, get that promise in writing.)
		The landlord will give you a copy of the list. Make sure you keep it.
	
	
	The reason for doing the inspection is to know the condition of the unit when you move in.
	
		That way, you aren‚Äôt charged when you move out for things that were missing or damaged when you moved in. This can help you get the maximum from your security deposit.
	
	
	You may want to document the move in ‚Äúissues‚Äù with pictures, but you should still make a written list -- and don't forget to do it within 5 days of moving in.


What if my landlord doesn‚Äôt do an inspection with me?


	IF your landlord doesn‚Äôt do an inspection with you, you can do one yourself and send a copy to the landlord. But, you should still do it within 5 days of moving in.


Why is it important that I have/keep a copy of my&nbsp;lease?


	A lease is an agreement to rent between a tenant (the renter) and the landlord. It&nbsp;sets out the terms of the contract between you and your landlord. It lets you know what to expect from the other person.
	If you have a dispute with your landlord, you should read the&nbsp;lease&nbsp;to see what terms are in there related to your issue.
	There are some things the law outlines about the arrangement between a landlord and their tenant, but bulk of the information for your situation will be found in your lease.


--&gt; This is why it is important to keep a copy of your lease (the agreement YOU made with that landlord).

Can my&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;enter my home?

&nbsp; YES, but:


	The landlord must give you notice before entering.
	He/she can only enter during reasonable hours.


However, the landlord can enter anytime without notice in case of an emergency.


	IF the landlord comes in without giving you notice, make a request in writing that you be provided notice.
	IF you have pets that are sensitive to bug spray or strangers, tell the landlord that.


If you can provide an email or phone number for daytime notice, that might be to your advantage.

What if my home is destroyed by a natural disaster?


	If your home is destroyed, it means that your home is no longer in a livable condition and it is no longer safe to stay.
	If your home has been destroyed by a fire, flood, tornado, or other natural disaster, you may leave the property right away.
	However, you need to tell your landlord within 5 days after you leave that you want to end your lease.


What happens if the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;does not fix or repair a problem?

A landlord is required to make sure rental property is in habitable conditions (i.e. livable).

When a landlord fails to make necessary repairs or maintenance after receiving a request from a tenant, there are several options a tenant can take:


	Rent Strike: Depending on the state law, a tenant can withhold rent until the repair is made.

	
		Kansas law doesn‚Äôt directly allow this, so you‚Äôd be taking a real chance of eviction for non-payment.
		That‚Äôs why, even though it‚Äôs a possible option, withholding rent is not the best option.
	
	
	Repair and Deduct: A tenant could also hire an outside party to make the necessary repairs.
	
		The tenant should be reasonable in choosing who to make the repairs.
		Kansas law doesn‚Äôt allow you to make the repairs and then automatically deduct the cost from your next rent check.
		YOU CAN, however, negotiate a reduction in rent for the repairs made. Be sure to make an agreement on the deduction before beginning the repairs and keep receipts for materials or services used.
	
	
	Complain to Government Officials: If the problem violates state or local building or health codes, a tenant may decide to contact the local authorities regarding the issue.


IF the problem is pervasive and disturbs the tenant‚Äôs right to live in a habitable structure, the tenant may choose to simply move out of the rental unit and end the lease agreement.

--&gt; Make sure to send your landlord a letter stating the reason the unit is no longer livable and the date you are leaving, along with an address where you can be reached and have your deposit check sent to.

What does a&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;have to repair?

The landlord is responsible for maintaining livable conditions, such as providing running water, heat, plumbing, electrical, etc.


	IF you are responsible for the water and it is shut off because you don‚Äôt pay your bill, that is not the landlord‚Äôs fault.
	IF the sewer backs up, that would be the landlord‚Äôs duty to repair. However, if the problem is something you caused (flushing diapers down the toilet, for example), the landlord can require you to pay for the cost of the repairs.


In your lease it should say who is responsible for making repairs.


	It is usually the landlord, but in some leases you can be required to make repairs.
	Go back and look through your lease, or ask your landlord for a copy.


What happens if repairs are not made?

You can make a list of things that need to be repaired, and then send it to your landlord asking that he/she fix the problems by a certain date.


	TIP: It‚Äôs always best to keep maintenance requests in writing.


IF the landlord is responsible for making repairs and he/she won‚Äôt repair your home,


	You can sue for damages and back rent, so long as you continue to pay rent.
	You can give 30 day notice to move out, but the landlord has 14 days to solve the problem.


What happens if there is damage to part of the house, but it doesn‚Äôt make it unlivable?


	Landlords must repair problems that make a rental unit unfit to live in, or ‚Äúuninhabitable.‚Äù While the unit is being rented, the landlord must do maintenance work and make repairs which are necessary to keep the unit livable.
	However, a landlord is not responsible for repairing damages which were caused by the tenant or the tenant‚Äôs family, guests, or pets.
	The landlord is responsible for repairing conditions that seriously affect the rental unit‚Äôs habitability.
	But whether the landlord or the tenant is responsible for making less serious repairs is usually determined by the lease agreement.


Can a&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;make me agree to live in a place that is uninhabitable?

No, a landlord cannot force you to accept unsafe or unfit housing.

Can the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;have rules and regulations for the property?

Yes, rules and regulations are usually listed in the lease (such as no pets allowed, no noise after midnight, etc.)


	All rules must apply to all tenants
	They should benefit the tenant‚Äôs welfare or protect the landlord‚Äôs property


Do I have to follow changes in the rules after my&nbsp;lease&nbsp;starts? What type of notice should I receive?

IF the landlord makes rules about the use of rental facilities

--&gt; The tenant must follow the rules IF:


	&nbsp;they are fair,
	&nbsp;reasonable, and
	&nbsp;if the tenant gets a copy of the rules at the time the tenant enters into the rental agreement.


IF the landlord makes a NEW rule or changes a current rule after the tenant begins renting,


	The landlord must give the tenant reasonable notice of the rule change.
	The landlord can place the notice in a common area or may tape it to your front door.


What if I want someone to move in with me?

You need to check with your landlord before someone else moves in with you.

IF someone moves in with you, and their name is not on the lease or the landlord does not know about it


	It might violate the original lease and the landlord might start the&nbsp;eviction&nbsp;process


How does&nbsp;eviction&nbsp;work?

A landlord CANNOT evict you by shutting off utilities, or by changing the locks.


	If this happens, you might be able to sue your landlord in small claims court and get up to one and one-half (1-1/2) month‚Äôs rent.


A landlord CAN evict you by giving you 3 days notice to leave the property.


	This could be for not paying rent or staying after your lease ends.
	If you do not leave or pay the rent within 3 days, the landlord will start the&nbsp;eviction&nbsp;lawsuit.


IF you didn't follow the lease:

For material noncompliance with the lease agreement (violating a section of the lease agreement for having pets or other people living with you) other than not paying rent:

--&gt; The landlord must serve you with a Kansas&nbsp;eviction&nbsp;notice of 14 days for you to comply with the part of the lease that has been violated.


	It must state that the lease will end 14 days after service unless the issue is fixed
	If you do not fix the issue, you must vacate within the following 30 days or legal action will begin.
	If you ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem, send the landlord a letter stating how you fixed the problem. (For example, if it is a pet, send a letter saying that you removed the pet from the property.)
	If you have gotten one notice to fix a problem and another lease violation occurs, you don‚Äôt get a second notice. This applies even if you fixed the first problem.


IF the landlord starts legal action:

If the landlord starts legal action

--&gt; You will receive a petition that states why you are being evicted and the amount of rent you owe, if any.


	You may receive this by mail, by the Sheriff, or taped to your front door.
	The front page will be a Summons, saying when you should go to Court.
	The second page will be a Petition, saying the things the landlord believes are true and what the landlord wants in terms of money and possession of the residence.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


The Summons will have a Court hearing time and date, where you must show up to Court. This court date will happen within 14 days after you get the Petition.


	IF you do not go to court on this first date, the landlord automatically wins (called default) and gets whatever they asked for in the papers, both the money owed and possession of the property.
	IF you disagree with what the petition says (either in terms of money or possession of the property) you should go to the first court hearing. You can file an answer before the trial.
	In the answer you should state the facts of the issue and any defenses you have against the landlord‚Äôs claims.
	
		&nbsp;Some examples:
		
			The landlord accepted some rent, so you don‚Äôt owe the whole amount;
			the unit was not livable (must have proof of this, like a housing inspection and notice to the landlord and you can‚Äôt have been living there);
			the landlord failed to fix an unsafe or unsanitary condition despite written notice from you and a 14 day chance to fix the problem; or
			you were evicted on the basis of religion, gender, or disability.
		
		
	
	


A date for an eviction trial will be set by the Court at the first Court hearing, usually no later than 8 days after the first court hearing.


	Both sides will present their cases
	BUT the landlord must prove that you either failed to pay the rent owed or did not fix the lease violation


IF the landlord wins, the court will issue a judgment of possession for the landlord, and you will be given a certain time to move out.


	This could be as little as 24 hours to move out


What if I try to pay the rent within 3 days, but the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;doesn‚Äôt take the money?

The rent is ‚Äúpaid‚Äù when you put it in the mailbox, stamped and addressed to the landlord.


	You can also put it in a landlord‚Äôs dropbox.
	Don‚Äôt put it in the landlord‚Äôs mailbox, as only mail delivered by the US Post Office can go there.
	
		If you do this, take a picture of the check with the date of the check showing.
	
	
	It might be a good idea to take a picture of yourself putting it in the mail box and have the camera put a date on the picture.
	You can get a money order and make sure the date is on it and keep the date receipt.
	
		You still need the picture showing you mailed it to the landlord within the 3 days (24 hour periods).
	
	


What if I left&nbsp;personal property&nbsp;behind when I was evicted?

If you left&nbsp;personal property&nbsp;behind, the landlord can take your belongings, place it in a storage unit at your cost, sell it, or get rid of your property 30 days after the landlord takes possession.

Within 15 days, the landlord must publish notice in the newspaper that states:


	your name,
	a description of the property, and
	the date the landlord plans to get rid of the property.


Then after it is published in the newspaper, the landlord must mail a copy of the notice to your last known address.

--&gt; Overall you have 30 days to claim your property, but you will have to pay for any costs the landlord had to pay on your behalf.

What if I was in the process of moving out and the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;thought I had moved out and took the property I still had in the apartment?

IF the landlord illegally takes your property while you‚Äôre living in the unit

--&gt; You can make a written request for them to return your property or give you access to it.


	Give a deadline and keep a copy for yourself.


What is the Fair Housing Act?

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing and other discriminatory practices.


	The landlord MAY NOT discriminate against tenants on the basis of race, gender, religion, familial status disability, or ethnicity.
	
		However, a landlord CAN consider criminal history, credit rating, and financial stability when making a decision to rent.
	
	
	This act also requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
	
		The Act provides that reasonable accommodations can be made in: rules, polices, practices or services, when such accommodations are necessary to afford a person equal opportunity to use the dwelling.
		Therefore, as long as the request is not unduly burdensome, housing providers must grant a request for reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities.
	
	


--&gt;&nbsp;Read about&nbsp;Fair Housing Rights that Protect You Under the Law.

How do I file a housing discrimination complaint?

IF you have been trying to buy or rent a home or apartment AND you believe your&nbsp;civil rights&nbsp;have been violated,


	You can file your fair housing complaint online with HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)&nbsp;here.
	You can also try the&nbsp;Kansas Human Rights Commission.


What is the legal obligation for two people on a&nbsp;lease?

Leases generally don‚Äôt state the rent obligations between two individuals.


	This means that if one person fails to pay rent or moves out before the lease is up, the other person will still have to make a full payment when the rent is due.
	TIP: You can create a written agreement with your roommate that covers things between you.


What if I want to sublet my unit?

LOOK AT YOUR LEASE.


	Some leases prohibit subletting and others require you to get written consent from your landlord.


What if I‚Äôm active duty military?

According to the Service Members Civil Relief Act:

IF you enroll in military service or if you‚Äôre already a service member, you or your dependents have a right to terminate a lease agreement IF:


	you receive permanent change of station orders;
	or an order to deploy with a military unit;
	or if you‚Äôre in support of a military operation of at least 90 days.


--&gt; If this happens, you may break your agreement no matter what it says in the lease.

Notify your landlord in writing that you need to terminate your lease, and provide a copy of your military orders.


	You can give notice by hand delivery, through a private business carrier such as UPS or FedEx, or by certified mail.
	Once the notice is mailed or delivered to the landlord, the&nbsp;tenancy&nbsp;will terminate 30 days after the day that rent is next due.
	
		For example, if rent is due on the first of June and you mail a notice on May 28, the&nbsp;tenancy&nbsp;will terminate on July 1, and you will no longer be responsible for rent after July 1.
	
	
	You should also provide the landlord with a forwarding address so he/she can mail you your remaining&nbsp;security deposit.


What do I need to do when I move out?

The terms that end a lease are something that differs from lease to lease. You should read your lease carefully.


	It might require that you give the landlord at least 30 days notice if you will not be renewing your lease.
	
		If that is the situation, make a note on your calendar at least 45 days before the end of the lease, so you know when to give the notice and don‚Äôt forget.
	
	
	If you have a rental agreement (a written contract without a certain ending date) you may give the landlord notice at any point.
	
		You can move out and owe no more rent on the rent due date 30 days after you mail the notice.
		
			This notice needs to be in writing, it should state that you want your remaining security deposit back, the date you plan on moving out, and your new address so he/she can send you the remaining security deposit.
			If you can‚Äôt give a new address on the date you give the move out notice, be sure to give it to the landlord when you move out.
		
		
	
	


Can I use my&nbsp;security deposit&nbsp;to pay my last month‚Äôs rent?

No, you must pay your last month‚Äôs rent.


	You can write a letter asking your landlord if you can use the security deposit as rent for the last month, BUT the landlord must agree and it should be in writing.
	IF you do not pay your last month‚Äôs rent
	
		You forfeit your security deposit AND the landlord may start legal action in small claims court to recover the amount of rent owed.

Wichita police Officer Nate Schwiethale stands with Fred Linker, aka ‚ÄúRooster.‚Äù Schwiethale played a large part in getting Linker off the streets as a homeless person.&nbsp;Courtesy photo

&nbsp;

BY MATT RIEDL &nbsp; Nov. 19, 2015 &nbsp;Wichita Eagle &nbsp;mriedl@wichitaeagle.com

&nbsp;

Fred Linker and Nate Schwiethale are unlikely friends.

When they first met, Linker was homeless. He had a long beard, and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for him to drink half a gallon of vodka daily.

Schwiethale is a police officer.

He leads the Wichita Police Department‚Äôs Homeless Outreach Team, which he built from the ground up since its inception in 2013.

Linker is one of the program‚Äôs success stories. He now has stable employment, owns a house and multiple cars.

He credits Schwiethale and the other outreach officers, as well as various city housing officials, for saving him from certain death on the streets, where he lived for 22 years.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy and content with where I‚Äôm at,‚Äù Linker said. ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt for those people, I‚Äôd probably be dead today. I‚Äôd be the next statistic.‚Äù

Schwiethale and Linker still text each other almost daily. He and his wife have been over to Linker‚Äôs house for a housewarming barbecue, and he usually eats lunch with Linker weekly.

Linker calls Schwiethale ‚Äúmy brother.‚Äù

Schwiethale has made it his personal goal to reduce Wichita‚Äôs homeless population.

And it‚Äôs working.

Development of outreach

When Schwiethale first joined the Wichita Police Department in 2001, there was no Homeless Outreach Team, nor any semblance of camaraderie between the homeless and police.

He responded to call after call: vagrancy, panhandling, drinking in public.

‚ÄúI just kind of realized I was spinning my wheels a lot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was a revolving door through the court system. I kept seeing the same guys. Ten years later they were still homeless.‚Äù

So he started looking for better ways to solve Wichita‚Äôs homeless problem. He found inspiration in the Colorado Springs Police Department and adopted some of its policies in developing Wichita‚Äôs Homeless Outreach Team, a nearly 10-year project.

The goal of the team, which employs three officers and a supervisor, is to divert minor charges away from homeless individuals and get them to service providers that will remedy the root causes of their homelessness.

‚ÄúIt tries to build a friendship or a partnership and get them to trust us so we can work on their recovery,‚Äù Schwiethale said. ‚ÄúYou have to change the way you operate, have to treat them almost like a family member.‚Äù

The ‚ÄòRooster‚Äô and the cop

Linker, who said he is widely known on the streets as ‚ÄúRooster,‚Äù was homeless on Wichita‚Äôs streets for 22 years before Schwiethale came into his life.

He says he is a chronic alcoholic and always will be, but he has not touched alcohol in three years.

‚ÄúThat was my numbness,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat was my medicine to block everything out, and it‚Äôs took a toll on me.‚Äù

Linker now works full-time at a woodworking shop and has his own side business he operates on the weekends. He first met Schwiethale when he was drunk in 2012. Schwiethale caught Linker urinating in public.

Schwiethale recognized the potential in Linker and saw what kind of person he could become, he said.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good person, very trustworthy ‚Äì he just had a drinking problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat was it. That was the reason he was homeless.‚Äù

So he kept coming back.

Schwiethale busted Linker multiple times for public urination and disorderly conduct, taking him to detox services in Wichita 13 times.

He didn‚Äôt give up.

‚ÄúHe was like your extreme homeless guy in the park every day, drinking a beer and refusing the shelters,‚Äù Schwiethale said. ‚ÄúThe police officers were fed up with him.‚Äù

One day, Schwiethale ran into Linker at Seneca Park. He was sitting alone at the tennis courts with a brand-new fifth of vodka in hand.

Schwiethale pulled his police cruiser in front of Linker.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm fixing to get drunk today,‚Äù Linker replied.

‚ÄúYou really want that, to go to jail?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what, jail sounds pretty good ‚Äì three hots and a cot ‚Äì but you know what, can you help me better?‚Äù Linker said.

Linker handed him his unopened bottle of vodka, which Schwiethale opened and poured on the ground before taking Linker to detox services.

‚ÄúThe average alcoholic with have seven relapses on average before he finally quits and turns his life around ‚Äì you have to understand that part of the process and just accept it,‚Äù Schwiethale said.

Linker enrolled in the Housing First program and started turning his life around. He now is completely self-sufficient and draws no government assistance.

Three years later, Linker remains friends with Schwiethale, the man who saved him from the streets.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great guy, and I still enjoy his company,‚Äù Schwiethale said. ‚ÄúTo see someone like Rooster turn aroud and do what he‚Äôs doing, that says a lot to people about the effectiveness of our program.‚Äù

Homeless in Wichita

While homeless shelters typically open overflow spaces to accommodate increased demand in the winter, some homeless people opt not to use them.

Linker said he rarely went to shelters when he was on the street.

‚ÄúA lot of them look at it as a handout that‚Äôs a recurring thing over and over,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI go to McDonald‚Äôs for breakfast every day before I go to work on North Broadway, and I see so many that‚Äôve got the potential, that I‚Äôve lived with on the streets, that have been kicked out of the program.

‚ÄúThey just choose ‚Ä¶ to stay stuck.‚Äù

Denny Bender, executive director of the Union Rescue Mission on North Hillside, said some homeless people don‚Äôt trust shelters.

‚ÄúMost of the men I‚Äôve talked to, they choose to live that way because of a lack of trust with other individuals or they have been hurt or want to maintain their independence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want anyone telling them what they can or can‚Äôt do and they‚Äôre willing to endure the inconvenience and the degrading nature of homelessness just to maintain that independence.‚Äù

Homelessness is a complex issue and one that‚Äôs scope is difficult to ever get a good grasp on, despite ‚Äúvaliant‚Äù efforts by the United Way of the Plains to count the homeless every January, Bender said.

According to a 2015 point-in-time count, Wichita had 561 people who were ‚Äúliterally‚Äù homeless, which means a person lacks a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence. That includes people in emergency shelters and transitional housing, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The numbers&nbsp;showed an 11 percent decrease&nbsp;compared to 2014.

Pat Hanrahan, president of the United Way of the Plains, said in May that decrease can be attributed to increased cooperation between local agencies that serve the homeless.

Schwiethale‚Äôs team with the police department surely accounts for some of those figures as well.

The Homeless Outreach Team was recently recognized by the federal government to be used as a role model for other departments across the country starting similar programs.

Since getting off the streets himself, Linker now pays it back by assisting Schwiethale and the outreach team by providing information on other homeless people in Wichita.

Being homeless in Wichita for 22 years, he said he knows ‚Äúprobably 90 percent‚Äù of chronically homeless people in Wichita.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got eyes and ears on the streets,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust because I‚Äôm out of the elements doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on out here because I care about my brothers.‚Äù

Linker encouraged others who may be struggling with homelessness not to be afraid to ‚Äústick your foot out‚Äù and admit you need help.

He said he has buried 13 people he used to live with out on Wichita‚Äôs streets, the most recent in October. He doesn‚Äôt want there to be a 14th.

‚ÄúI do not wish homelessness on anybody,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere (are) places out there that will help, and that‚Äôs a fact.‚Äù

DEFINING HOMELESSNESS

Health centers funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services define a homeless person as one ‚Äúwithout permanent housing who may live on the streets; stay in a shelter, mission, single room occupancy facilities, abandoned building or vehicle; or in any other unstable or non-permanent situation.‚Äù

Health centers funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development have a different definition: ‚ÄúAn individual who lacks a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence,‚Äù or ‚Äúwho has a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings, including a car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, airport, or camping ground.‚Äù This also includes people living in supervised shelters. This definition is the one used by the United Way‚Äôs point-in-time count.

By Russ Erdem, City Reporter &nbsp; Posted Jan 5, 2017 &nbsp;Great Bend Tribune

Homelessness is on the rise in Kansas and right here in our own town this issue can be seen by taking a drive by the river just outside of Great Bend in the warmer months, visiting the soup kitchen that feeds nearly 70 people on any given day or just taking a drive down 10th Street.

‚ÄúHomelessness is a great concern for Great Bend,‚Äù Dream Center Director Kimberly Becker said. ‚ÄúI think we have a misconception of what homelessness looks like. When you think of people being homeless, you think of people sleeping on park benches or sleeping right on the street. Here in Great Bend it takes a different look.

‚ÄúIt can be the couple walking their children to school, it can be the person walking down 10th Street with all their belongings in a backpack. It can be the person walking to work but can‚Äôt afford a place of their own to live so they are forced to live in their vehicle. This is our homeless in Great Bend.‚Äù&nbsp;


According to Becker, there are approximately 50 homeless people in Great Bend.


This includes men, women, single mothers and couples with children. Barton County ranks in the top five per capita for children without homes for the entire state.

‚ÄúMost of the homeless families sleep in their vehicles because there is no shelter for families in Great Bend right now,‚Äù Becker said. ‚ÄúThey can go to other towns that do, but they don‚Äôt want to remove their children from school so they just do what they can to survive and keep their families warm.‚Äù

According to the Kansas Statewide Homeless Coalition, the leading factors to homelessness in Barton County include: no affordable housing, alcohol/drug abuse, jobless, eviction, changing jobs or housing, domestic violence, illness and incarceration.&nbsp;

‚ÄúWhat we need in our community is more collaboration to combat these different factors that lead to homelessness and to work together to help these people in anyway we can,‚Äù Becker said. ‚ÄúIt is very hard going from homeless to having a place of your own, but with a little help it can be done.‚Äù

CitizenshipWorks!

Who is Citizenshipworks for?

Citizenshipworks is for residents of the United States who are eligible to apply for naturalization.

They must show that:


	They have been a Lawful Permanent Resident (have a green card) and have lived in the&nbsp;United States for several years;
	They are of ‚Äúgood moral character,‚Äù including that they have paid their taxes and&nbsp;followed the laws of the United States;
	They are not a threat to national security; and
	They support the U.S. Constitution and are willing to take an oath of allegiance to the&nbsp;United States.


&nbsp;

Frequently Asked Questions in English and Spanish are available.

&nbsp;

Why use Citizenshipworks instead of just filling out the form directly?

Anyone can download the naturalization form and fill it out directly. However, by using&nbsp;Citizenshipworks, legal information and definitions are provided for better understanding and&nbsp;potential legal issues are flagged. In addition, Citizenshipworks walks you through the document&nbsp;so that you know which fields you need to complete and which you don‚Äôt.&nbsp;Citizenshipworks provides an added benefit for those who are more comfortable filling out the&nbsp;form in Spanish. The downloadable form cannot be submitted in Spanish. The Citizenshipworksinterview can be used in Spanish to generate an English N-400 application form.

&nbsp;

¬øCitizenshipworks ofrece consejo legal?

Citizenshipworks no ofrece consejo legal, y sus creadores no son un despacho de abogados. El&nbsp;sistema determina si hay asuntos legales comunes y ""alerta"" a una aplicaci√≥n con una marca&nbsp;de seguridad. Luego, el solicitante de la ciudadan√≠a puede ponerse en contacto con alguien en&nbsp;nuestra red de expertos legales quienes pueden discutir el problema y ayudar a resolver esas&nbsp;alertas a trav√©s del sistema.

This report explains the factors that contribute to this gap, and how homeless shelters can be part of the solution.Profiles of Risk No. 10: Father Involvement&nbsp;&nbsp;8/2012This brief, the tenth in the ‚ÄúProfiles of Risk‚Äù series examining characteristics of homeless families in the United States, explores differences in father involvement by families' housing status. Compared with their stably housed peers, unstably housed children have fathers who are less able to contribute to their well-being; fathers of children who ever experience homelessness are more likely to be young, to be unmarried, to have low incomes, to be incarcerated, and to abuse drugs than the fathers of children who are stably housed. Fathers of unstably housed children make fewer financial contributions and spend less time with their sons and daughters than fathers of stably housed children.Profiles of Risk No. 9: Child HealthThis brief, the ninth in the ‚ÄúProfiles of Risk‚Äù series examining characteristics of homeless families in the United States, explores differences in the health of children by their housing status. Children of unstably housed mothers have low birth weight, suffer from asthma, and visit emergency rooms more often than,their stably housed peers. Ever-homeless children also visit dentists less frequently than those who are stably housed, suggesting that children who experience housing instability experience health disparities from an early stage.Profiles of Risk No. 8: School Readiness5/2012This brief, the eighth in the ‚ÄúProfiles of Risk‚Äù series examining characteristics of homeless families in the United States, explores differences in the school readiness of children by their housing status. Children who ever experienced homelessness in their first five years exhibit higher behavioral and attention problems and score lower on cognitive tests than their stably housed peers. These findings suggest that children who experience housing instability enter school less ready to learn than their stably housed counterparts.Profiles of Risk No. 7: Child Care4/2012This brief, the seventh in the ""Profiles or Risk"" series examining characteristics of homeless families in the United States, explores differences in child care by housing status. Ever-homeless women receive child care subsidies less often than their stably housed peers and are the most likely to use informal arrangements that provide few developmental supports for children. Ever-homeless women also report more frequent disruptions of employment or training due to unreliable child care.The Impact of Food Stamp Benefits on Family Homelessness in New York City4/2012In 2010, 50% more New York City families received SNAP benefits, or food stamps, than at the start of the recession in 2007. Unfortunately, these benefits are calculated without accounting for the City‚Äôs higher cost of food, depriving these families of the same degree of relief felt elsewhere. This brief outlines how families at risk of homelessness are struggling to balance adequate nutrition with housing costs.Profiles of Risk No. 6: Maternal Health and Well-being3/2012This brief, the sixth in the ""Profiles or Risk"" series examining characteristics of homeless families in the United States, explores differences in health and health behaviors between&nbsp;unstably housed poor mothers and mothers who maintain stable housing, finding that unstably housed poor mothers experience worse physical and mental health, report more drug use, and are exposed to higher rates of domestic violence than stably housed poor mothers. Notably, some unstably housed women report better outcomes when single, highlighting the importance of relationship status in the lives of homeless women.Intergenerational Disparities Experienced by Homeless Black Families3/2012The stark reality is that black Americans are greatly overrepresented in U.S. homelessness and poverty statistics when compared to whites. In 2010, one out of every 141 black family members stayed in a homeless shelter, a rate seven times higher when compared with persons in white families (one in 990). This brief outlines some of the longstanding and interrelated social and structural issues that leave black families more likely to experience homelessness.",

DPOA",Powers of attorney / advance directives,"What Is A Power Of Attorney?

A power of attorney gives one or more persons the power to act on your behalf. It can be limited to a certain task, such as closing the sale of your home, or be general. You can give the person either brief or permanent power to act.&nbsp;

What Is An Agent?

The person named in a power of attorney to act for you is commonly referred to as your ""agent"". With a valid power of attorney, your agent can take any action allowed in the document. Often your agent must present the actual document to invoke the power.&nbsp;

What Are The Types of Power Of Attorney?

Kansas allows both durable and nondurable powers of attorney.


	A nondurable power of attorney ends when the principal becomes disabled.
	A durable power of attorney, in contrast, does not. For example, if you give someone a nondurable power of attorney to access your bank account and then you become disabled, that agent will no longer be able to access your account. However, if you gave them a durable power of attorney, they could continue to access your account. Many people use durable powers of attorney for healthcare decisions they would like made if they were to become disabled. For this reason, it is important to discuss what you would like to have done, should you become disabled, with anyone to whom you give a durable power of attorney.


When Does It End?

A power of attorney ends as specified in the document, but it can be changed or revoked before it is set to end. In Kansas, the principal can revoke the power of attorney by telling the agent, either orally or in writing, that he is ending it. The principal may also tell others that the power of attorney is ending so that they know the agent‚Äôs powers are cut off.

Living Will
HCDPOA
Durable Power of Attorney
DPOA",Powers of attorney / advance directives,"The main question these documents address is ‚Äúwho controls your health care if you are not able to make decisions yourself?‚Äù

The Documents:

Kansas statutes make two legal documents available to you to make sure your wishes are followed:


	A ‚Äúliving will‚Äù: A written statement of your wishes regarding your medical treatment if you are in a terminal condition. It must be witnessed by two individuals over eighteen, and it is only effective if two physicians have determined that you are terminally ill.
	Durable&nbsp;power of attorney&nbsp;for health care decisions: A written document in which you authorize someone whom you name (your ‚Äúagent‚Äù or ‚Äúattorney-in-fact‚Äù) to make health care decisions for you in the event you are unable to speak for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		Health care decisions include the power to consent, refuse consent, or withdraw consent to any type of medical care, treatment, service, or procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		In the document you can give specific instructions regarding your health care that will require the agent to make decisions in accordance with your direction.
	
	


You may also be able to complete documents which differ from these forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;These so-called ‚Äúcommon-law‚Äù forms can be discussed with your lawyer.

What is the difference between a health care power of attorney and a ‚Äúliving will‚Äù?


	Power of attorney can cover all medical decisions. Living wills only apply to decisions regarding ‚Äúlife-sustaining treatment‚Äù in the event of a ‚Äúterminal illness.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		A terminal illness does not include Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease, dementia, or coma.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
	
	A durable health care power of attorney can be effective any time or, if you want, at any time you are unable to make or communicate a decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent you appoint can make any decision you direct, including decisions about health care beyond those covered by your living will.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		For example, the agent under a durable power of attorney can make decisions about care if you are in a persistent vegetative state, but are not terminally ill.
	
	
	Power of attorney appoints an agent to act on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;That person can weigh the pros and cons of treatment decisions in accordance with your directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
		Unless you limit the powers, the agent can hire physicians and other health care providers, decide where you will receive treatment, and make decisions about the full range of medical decisions from routine care to decisions about life-sustaining treatment.
	
	


Do I lose control by appointing an agent?

Limiting power:


	You can write your living will and your durable power of attorney to include specific limits about anything you want to have done or want to avoid having done.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	You can express your wishes about whatever you care most about.&nbsp;&nbsp;


Ending it:


	You can end your health care power of attorney at any time by telling your agent and health care provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	You can end the power of attorney verbally, but it is best to do so in writing and to destroy the original document.


Why do I need a living will or health care power of attorney?

Simple Answer: Without these documents, your wishes may not be followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In some situations, a&nbsp;guardian&nbsp;may be limited in making some decisions, especially those regarding life-sustaining treatment when you are in a vegetative state but not terminally ill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also, a guardian chosen by the court may have no idea what your wishes are and may disagree with those that do know your wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The existence of the document can relieve some of the stress or conflict that otherwise might arise if family or friends have to decide on their own what you would want done when you cannot speak for yourself.

Do I need both the living will and the durable power of attorney?

It is recommended you have both documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The living will provides clear evidence of your wishes concerning medical care and treatment and will help ensure that the agent and physicians carry out your wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The durable power of attorney for health care gives your agent the authority to take action on your behalf and to carry out your directions for health care, without the delays of court proceedings.

How do I make a living will or a durable power of attorney for health care?

The legislature has adopted forms for both the living will and the durable power of attorney.&nbsp;&nbsp;


	Those forms are included below.


In addition, a lawyer can draft a document which specifically incorporates your wishes and may be more detailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Take time to consider all the possibilities and seek competent advice so the documents you develop meet your special needs.

Once I have the documents what do I do?

Even as you draft the documents you should talk about your values and wishes with your physician(s), anyone you will appoint as an agent or alternate agent, and those who are close to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

You should give a copy of the documents to all of your physicians, your agent under the durable power of attorney, and your family or friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you retain the originals, tell someone where the papers can be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Place the original in a secure place which someone can access without court intervention.

**Remember, a Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care Decisions provide&nbsp;you a way to maintain control of your health care.

TODD",Powers of attorney / advance directives,"What is a Transfer on Death Deed?

A transfer-on-death (TOD) deed, also called a beneficiary deed, looks like a regular deed used to transfer real estate. But there's a crucial divide: It doesn't take effect until your death. You are free to change your mind and revoke the deed at any time during your life.

For Land, Home, Certain types of oil gas and mineral rights, and Royalties thereof:


	
	A TOD is a document that can be prepared and signed at any time.&nbsp;
	
	
	It directs the transfer of your interest in property to another person at the moment of your death.&nbsp;
	
	
	It doesn‚Äôt avoid creditors or SRS Estate Recovery.&nbsp; It doesn‚Äôt avoid taxes (although only very large estates are taxed in Kansas now).&nbsp;
	
	
	It doesn‚Äôt transfer ownership until your death, so you don‚Äôt cause possible Medicaid Transfer of Asset penalties.&nbsp;
	
	
	You still own your property, so you can sell it at any time.&nbsp;
	
	
	Property owned in joint tenancy with right of survivorship is fully transferred to the surviving owner, upon the death of one owner.
	
	
	Note:&nbsp; You must give an exact legal description of the property, so obtaining a copy of your deed is best.&nbsp;
	


For Car, Recreational or Other vehicle:


	
	Transfer on Death Form ‚Äì this is a label you can have added to your car title.&nbsp;
	
	
	It is best to do with when pay your annual vehicle registration.&nbsp;
	
	
	Work with the County Treasurer or Tag office to complete the paperwork.&nbsp;
	
	
	The vehicle will be transferred to them upon the proof of death of all owners.
	
	
	This must be done for each vehicle owned.
	


&nbsp;

Making it official:


	
	A TOD for Land, home, or mineral and oil rights should be filed with the Recorder of Deeds in the county where the real estate is located.

	
		
		A small fee is included for recording the deed.
		
		
		You will need a full description of your real estate.
		
	
	
	
	A TOD for Vehicles can be recorded by taking the title to the County Treasurer in the owner‚Äôs county of residence and paying a fee.
	
	
	The grantor need not inform the recipient or get their approval to be able to record a TOD.
	


&nbsp;

What are the benefits of a Transfer on Death Deed?

- A TOD allows you to transfer ownership of property after death by naming a recipient and bypassing the probate process.


	
	Even if you choose a beneficiary of a piece of property in your will, it will still need to be probated.
	
	
	A TOD however will not go through the probate system and transfers the property without the need for court and clerical fees.
	


- TOD do not replace wills.


	
	It is still a good idea to have a valid will in place to properly give out your estate.
	
	
	A TOD has a place within an estate plan along with a will, but should not replace a will totally.
	
	
	Make sure to check out our KLS resource: Do I Need A Will?
	


- A benefit of the TOD is that, because the recipient has no interest in the property until the owner dies, the recipient‚Äôs creditors cannot reach the property.

- In contrast with the transfer of property under a revocable trust or a will, the transfer of property through a TOD deed is much less costly.


	
	In some states the cost of probate is great, and in any state a probate proceeding will cost more than the fees related to a TOD deed.
	


&nbsp;

What are possible drawbacks of Transfer on Death Deeds?

A downside of TOD deeds is that people may use them without consulting a lawyer and may make legal mistakes. For example, an owner might name one beneficiary but neglect to arrange for the possibility that the recipient predeceases the owner.

&nbsp;

Revoking a TOD?

To revoke a TOD, it must be done formally and in writing.


	
	Simply denying a TOD in a will is not enough to undo the TOD.

&nbsp;


Health Care Directives: What are they?

Healthcare Directives tell your loved ones and doctors how you want to be cared for in the event you become unfit to care for yourself. These cases can come up when you are, for example, in an accident or on life support.

These decisions include choice of doctors, decisions about whether to go to the hospital or be resuscitated, consent for organ donation and long term care. You can decide if someone can make decisions for you and appoint a specific person for that task.

In Kansas, your spouse is not automatically your power of attorney should you become unable to make those healthcare decisions. &nbsp;

Advanced directives include Healthcare power of attorney, living wills and do not resuscitate orders.


Healthcare Durable Power of Attorney:


	A signed, notarized or witnessed document.
	Allows you to name a person, an agent or proxy, to make healthcare decisions for you if you become disabled or incapacitated.
	You can be specific or general in the terms of the document as to what the powers of the agent are. These powers can include whether they can decide if you need to go to the hospital, what doctor to see, whether you need long term care, consent for life-sustaining procedures, organ donation, etc.
	Person signing the DPOA for HC must be 18 and competent when signing.
	Witnesses must be 18 and cannot be related to the person or have an interest in the person's estate.
	It becomes effective once the person becomes incapacitated.
	The agent may not revoke or cancel a person‚Äôs living will.
	Make sure you talk to the person you have chosen about your wishes ahead of time. This way they can care for you in a way that reflects your wishes.
	For more info on DPOA for HC


Living Wills:


	A signed, notarized or witnessed legal document.
	The living will provides that if two doctors agree that you will not recover from a terminal condition, your life will not be artificially prolonged. You will be allowed to die naturally.
	Medicine and procedures for comfort care will still be administered.
	Must be 18 and competent to execute.
	Witnesses must be 18 and cannot be the agent or relative of the person or have a financial interest in the estate.
	The Living Will applies only when the person has been diagnosed and certified as terminally ill by two doctors. One of the doctors is the patient‚Äôs attending physician.
	Terminally ill tends to mean that death will probably occur within six months, regardless of whether life-sustaining measures are used.
	The Living Will does not apply to a person in a coma or persistent vegetative state unless the person is also diagnosed as terminally ill.
	For more info on Living Wills


Do Not Resuscitate Order:


	A signed, dated and witnessed form.
	Lets an adult say in advance that, should their heart stops beating or if they stop breathing, they do not wish to have medical procedures done to restart that activity.
	This does not stop other emergency medical care from being given.
	Person must be 18 and competent when papers are signed to execute.
	Papers must also be signed by your attending physician.



Can I change my advance directive?

You may change or cancel your advance directive at any time, as long as you are held to be of sound mind to do so. Being of sound mind means that you are still able to think rationally and convey your wishes in a clear manner. Again, your changes must be made, signed and notarized according to Kansas law. Make sure that your doctor and any family members who knew about your directives are also aware that you have changed them.

If you do not have time to put your changes in writing, you can make them known while you are in the hospital. Tell your doctor and any family or friends present exactly what you want to happen. Usually, wishes that are made in person will be followed in place of the ones made earlier in writing. Be sure your instructions are clearly understood by everyone you have told.

Utility companies are not allowed to cut a customer's service when the weather will be at or below 35 degrees over the next 24 hours.

Any residential customer with a past due balance will be fit for a payment plan under the Rule. However, it is the customer's duty to contact the gas or electric company to set that up.

The rule also calls for utility companies to offer a 12-month payment plan. This is to allow users to keep or restore utility service.

The Cold Weather Rule applies only to residential customers of electric and natural gas utility companies under the KCC's area of control.

The Senior Citizen Law Project (SCLP)



The Senior Citizen Law Project (SCLP) gives legal services to persons age 60 and older. SCLP focuses on civil legal issues. The goal is to target older persons who have the greatest needs. Top issues include helping seniors get income and medical assistance needed for their well-being. Another top issue is stopping any abuse of elders. &nbsp;

SCLP also has an education program. &nbsp;Elders and workers serving them may learn about elders' rights and protections under the law.

If you or someone you know is a victim of elder abuse, help is available from the Elder Justice Initiative.

Elder Law Hotline&nbsp;

Elder Law Hotline&nbsp;is a project of KLS. Hotline attorneys answer questions in civil cases for Kansans age 60 or older. Cases may be referred to a local Senior Citizens Law Project attorney or a private attorney. The Elder Law Panel of lawyers is a partnership that KLS has with the Kansas Bar Association.

The&nbsp;Elder Law Hotline&nbsp;serves the rising need for quality elder law services in Kansas. In Kansas, many older persons may have health or physical problems or live in an isolated place. &nbsp;Because of this, a statewide Hotline service is a good way to get legal services to elderly Kansans.

In 2009, the Kansas Bar Association gave its annual Pro Bono Award to the Elder Law Hotline. &nbsp;This award recognizes a lawyer or law firm for the delivery of direct legal services free of charge to the poor.

Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) are programs that help pay for your Medicare medical costs. Remember Part A covers hospital care and Part B covers other medical care.&nbsp;

The Medicare Savings programs (MSP) do not have any estate recovery requirement.&nbsp;

If you think you might qualify for any of these benefits,&nbsp;print this application&nbsp;and send it to your local DCF (Kansas Department for Children and Families) office. &nbsp;Find your local office on this map:

Caregiver",Senior Citizens,"Thanks to a new law in Kansas, financial abuse of an elder is a serious crime and there are consequences.

Do you know someone who is being financially abused by a trusted person or&nbsp;power of attorney?&nbsp;It‚Äôs no longer a ‚Äúfamily issue.‚Äù It is a crime.

A law was passed during last year‚Äôs legislative session. It makes it a crime to take money from elders who are 70 years or older and for powers of attorney to misuse funds.&nbsp;



Indicators of financial abuse


	A recent contact expresses an interest in finances, promises to give care, or cozies up with the elder.
	A relative or caregiver has no visible means of support and is overly interested in the elder's financial affairs.
	A relative or caregiver is hesitant to spend money for needed medical treatment for the elder.&nbsp;
	The utility and other bills are not being paid.
	The elder's placement, care, or possessions clash with the size of his or her estate.
	A relative or caregiver isolates the elder, makes excuses when friends or family call or visit, and does not give the elder messages.
	A relative or caregiver gives unlikely reasons about finances, and the elder is unaware of or unable to explain the arrangements made.
	Checking account and credit card statements are sent to a relative or caregiver and are not open to the elder.
	At the bank, the elder is escorted by a relative or caregiver who refuses to let the elder speak for him- or herself. The elder appears nervous or afraid of the person going with him or her.
	The elder is concerned or confused about ""missing money.""
	There are suspicious signatures on the elder's checks, or the elder signs checks and another party fills in the payee and amount sections.
	There is an odd amount of banking activity, mainly just after joint accounts are set up or someone new starts helping with the elder's finances.
	A will,&nbsp;power of attorney, or other legal document is drafted, but the elder does not understand its effects.

A&nbsp;Notice of Overpayment&nbsp;is a letter that says you owe Social Security money. The notice may say that Social Security is going to take some of your SSI check to repay what you owe.

SSI Overpayment

If the&nbsp;Notice of Overpayment&nbsp;is about an SSDI overpayment, you should look at the&nbsp;SSDI Overpayments section&nbsp;below&nbsp;because the rules are different.

This page tells you what to do if you get SSI, Social Security sent you a&nbsp;Notice of Overpayment, and


	you think something on the&nbsp;Notice of Overpayment&nbsp;is wrong, or
	you can‚Äôt afford to pay back the money.


It is very important that you do NOT ignore the notices. If you think there is a mistake,&nbsp;contact Social Security and ask for an appeal form&nbsp;right away.

Steps you'll need to take

The following links will answer common questions you may have about what to do if you get a notice. The links will take you to another website that will answer your question.

In fact, the number of children in foster care has grown each year since 2010, with accelerated growth since 2012. This year, the number of kids in foster care broke a record previously set in 2008 during the height of the Great Recession.&nbsp;Yet officials with the Department for Children and Families say that ballooning number is a positive signal that shows how aware people have become about child abuse and neglect and that they're taking action to protect the state's children.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to chalk up to increased awareness and action ignores many of the realities in Kansas.It ignores that since 2011, Gov. Sam Brownback‚Äôs cabinet has implemented a variety of policy changes that resulted in fewer families who are eligible for&nbsp;help with child care,&nbsp;food assistance&nbsp;and&nbsp;public assistance.&nbsp;It ignores that the state adopted a&nbsp;tax policy that is disgustingly regressive&nbsp;‚Äì cutting taxes for businesses and higher earners, while eliminating tax credits that benefited poor working families.&nbsp;It ignores that the state consistently raids the&nbsp;Children‚Äôs Initiative Fund&nbsp;‚Äì money specifically designated for children‚Äôs programs ‚Äì to fill its budget shortfalls.&nbsp;And it ignores that because the governor and the Kansas Legislature hate ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù more than they care about Kansans, more poor families are&nbsp;trapped in a coverage gap&nbsp;where they are ineligible for lower cost insurance yet don‚Äôt qualify for coverage through Medicaid. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact,&nbsp;DCF reported that the number of Kansas households receiving public&nbsp;assistance fell from 24,567 in April 2011 to 11,867 households in April 2014 ‚Äì a reduction of nearly 52 percent in three years. &nbsp;While such drastic and immediate reductions play well on campaign materials, they also carry real life consequences that can‚Äôt easily be boiled down to political talking points. And Kansas is beginning to see those consequences with more kids in the foster care system. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kansans should ask whether we‚Äôre really saving that much money when we remove assistance on one end, only to end up paying for the care of more kids on the other end. And since children in foster care are more likely to drop out of school, earn less money, become single parents, end up incarcerated and rely on public assistance, it‚Äôs likely Kansans will be paying for the errors of this administration for generations to come. &nbsp; &nbsp;It should come as no surprise to anyone that Kansas is experiencing more problems in at-risk families and that more kids are being removed from their homes. Many of these children already endured lives of desperation, made more desperate and chaotic by elected officials who are guided by their own selfish ambitions ‚Äì and the misguided idea that saving a dollar today is worth spending 10 more a generation later.By Jason Probst/Hutchinson News editorial board",
360,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1899,Kansas needs to give more temporary assistance,,,State and Local Welfare,"By Lisa Mills

As I was waiting at an intersection today, I noticed a depressed and tired-looking woman holding a sign that said ‚ÄúHomeless. Please Help with Food.‚Äù

I overheard a man in a group next to me say very loudly to someone, ‚ÄúIf she needs food so bad, why is she so damn fat? She‚Äôs not homeless.‚Äù

I walked up to her and handed her a couple of crinkled dollars I had in my purse. She gave me a warm ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù and a strangely innocent smile.

It doesn‚Äôt matter to me whether she is actually homeless or not. What matters is that she felt the need to stand outside and beg for money on a busy street in the cold while people just passed by without even seeing her.

She was probably invisible to most people, who were holiday shopping on a busy Saturday, just trying to get to their next errand as they hurried to their cars.

She had a small dog with her in a cardboard box and what looked like a garbage bag filled with books, clothes and a flowered-print pillow decorated with blue lace.

I don‚Äôt know who she is, where she lives or doesn‚Äôt live. I don‚Äôt know if she dines out lavishly over five-course meals each evening or is really hungry. I don‚Äôt know if her situation was the fault of her own or just due to some very bad luck.

The fact is that she was there, and our human paths crossed at this exact time on this earth. And I feel grateful that I am not the one who was there with a cardboard sign, a box, a garbage bag and a thirsty dog.

A few questions

Doesn‚Äôt the man who made the rude comment know that many people who suffer from poverty also suffer from obesity and are actually malnourished, since cheap fast foods are extremely high in calories and devoid of any nutritional benefits?

Doesn‚Äôt he understand that maybe, just maybe, she might have been mentally ill or challenged in some way and that she was doing whatever she could to survive, at least for today?

Doesn‚Äôt he understand that the fact that she was standing there at all and asking for money and food means that she was asking for help in some way, and willing to ask complete strangers?

Doesn‚Äôt he understand that not everyone has it easy or even partly easy and that we all end up where we are, and that often there is nothing at all that we can do about it?

It could be you

I have a secret.

I was once very poor and nearly homeless for about six months because I left a bad marriage, taking my daughter with me. I needed help for a short time.

I was very young and I was very scared.

I didn‚Äôt end up out on the streets and I wasn‚Äôt hungry for food. I didn‚Äôt beg and I didn‚Äôt even tell anyone. I didn‚Äôt even tell my family how bad things had gotten because I was too ashamed and worried that my daughter would be taken from me.

That fear and shame is the stigma of poverty.

But I got through it because I reached out for help from some very kind strangers. I had a ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù of persons who helped people in situations like mine.

One of the resources was the Kansas Department for Children and Families. I received temporary assistance as I started a new life with my daughter. It helped us get through a tough time.

I was able to get childcare for my daughter as I found an affordable place to live, a good job and got on with my life.

That safety net is no longer available for vulnerable families in Kansas. So they have to try and get help in other ways.

Kansas has turned its back on poor people

The kind of assistance I got is called ""Temporary Assistance for Needy Families"" or TANF. The help is just that, cash for help through a brief time that someone needs to get their life on track.

The State of Kansas has made it so difficult to get temporary assistance that only a fraction of the needy can get it now. The TANF money to help people comes from the federal government, but each state can decide how to give it out and to whom.

Kansas says that people should work and that if they get cash from the state, they won‚Äôt try to help themselves. Kansas thinks that people will take the money it gives them and just sit around.

They think people will use the money to buy drugs or to gamble. They don‚Äôt trust people to use the funds to start a new life or get through some trouble, like I did.

Kansas Action for Children has written a report called TANF:Troubling Trends in Kansas. The report explains what has happened to the TANF program that is supposed to help families through hard times. The report also gives suggestions to the State of Kansas about how it can start helping people again.

Take notice of those around you

Whenever I see anyone asking for help, I take notice‚Äîas we all should, because none of us are very far away at all from being that woman I encountered today, or the millions of others who also find themselves in her position.

She is somebody‚Äôs daughter, granddaughter and perhaps someone‚Äôs mother and sibling.

But what matters is that she is a human being and that she was asking for help, without violence, without anger and without ruining anyone‚Äôs precious day.

I hope to see her again one day.

Hopefully next time it will be under better circumstances, and we could even share a cup of coffee together..

We can only hope, and in the meantime, we can help others out whenever we can.

When you are in KanCare, you have the right to appeal or file a grievance if you are unhappy with your plan in any way. Each MCO has its own process for you to use. Kansas also has a Fair Hearing process.

Q. I disagree with changes that my MCO plans to make to my care plan. What can I do?

A. Your KanCare MCO must send you a letter called a ""Notice of Action"" if it plans to make a change in your plan of care.

If the changes they want to make to your plan give you fewer services,fewer hours of a service or any change that you don't like, you can ask your MCO for a review. This review is done through an appeal to your KanCare MCO or through a State Fair Hearing request to Kansas.

You have the right to ask the MCO &nbsp;through an appeal&nbsp;to think again about the changes.

It was created by &nbsp;Kansas Advocates for Better Care and goes into much more detail about your rights if you are in KanCare.

TANF &amp; SNAP: &nbsp;Questions &amp; Answers 2016

This is an effort to provide frequently asked questions and answers about Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or&nbsp;TANF&nbsp;and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or&nbsp;SNAP,&nbsp;which are both projects administered by the State of Kansas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Kansas Legal Services and&nbsp;Kansas Appleseed&nbsp;worked together to present this information. &nbsp;Please access the&nbsp;Kansas Department for Children and Family Services website&nbsp;to learn more or to apply for either program.

1. &nbsp;How to use your card to pay for food or other items:


	Stores that accept the Vision card will have a sign posted with a picture of the card. Give your card to the clerk or slide it in the credit card machine.&nbsp; Type in your PIN number to complete the purchase.&nbsp;


2. &nbsp;To check your account balance:


	Go to&nbsp;www.ebtEDGE.com&nbsp;and enter your card number and pin. If using a public computer, close out of the account before leaving the computer.


Other tips:


	Don‚Äôt carry your Vision card next to your cell phone ‚Äì the magnet can make the metal strip on the Vision card not work.


3. &nbsp;How to use your card to get cash without a fee:


	Look for ‚ÄúKansas Vision Card Accepted Here‚Äù sign at store
	Make a purchase and select the cash back option (up to store‚Äôs limit)
	Go to customer service (up to $300 at Dillons or Walmart)
	Only 2 no-fee withdrawals per month; all others are 40 cents each


4. &nbsp;How to use your card to get cash&nbsp;with&nbsp;a fee:


	
	Use an ATM ($3+ in fees)
	


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

5. &nbsp;The Vision card works with Star System, Pulse, NYCE or SHAZAM ATMs.

You can search for ATM locations at&nbsp;http://www.kansaskidstable.org/tanf-atms.html


	If you request an ATM withdrawal and do not receive it, your account will be charged. To receive the benefits, call 1-800-997-6666 and file an ATM misdispense claim.
	If you haven‚Äôt received the benefits after 20 days, you can file a Notice of Appeal


6. &nbsp;Benefits become available at 6 a.m. on the 1st of each month

7. &nbsp;You can receive TANF benefits for only 24 months (total) in your lifetime.


	If your spouse or live-in partner has received benefits for 24 months, you can‚Äôt receive benefits.
	Some DCF TANF alternatives also count toward your 24-month TANF limit.
	
		You will lose one month of TANF eligibility for every month when you are working and DCF pays you a $50 Work Incentive Payment.
		You will lose six months of TANF eligibility if you participate in the TANF Diversion Program, which provides a one-time payment of up to $1,000 to meet an urgent need. You can‚Äôt receive TANF benefits for one year after the payment is made.
	
	



In May, 2016, the Kansas Legislature lowered the benefits for TANF again, to a 24-month lifetime limit. That law goes into effect July 1, 2016.&nbsp;


Kansas lowered the lifetime TANF limit from five years to four years in 2011 and to three years in 2015, then as part of the Hope, Opportunity and Prosperity for Everyone (HOPE) Act.

8. &nbsp;If your landlord or utility company doesn‚Äôt take the Vision card, you can pay in cash


	See&nbsp;#4&nbsp;for no-fee cash options.
	You can ask them to consider signing up to take the Vision card in the future.


Kansas DCF ends policy on $25 daily ATM withdrawal limit for TANF recipients

DCF has rescinded, or stopped, the policy that&nbsp;&nbsp;limited the amounts of cash a TANF recipient can withdraw from an ATM. &nbsp;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the policy would make it difficult for recipients to access their benefits. So the state had to take away the policy.

SNAP/food assistance


	Benefits must be used to purchase food.
	Benefits become available at 6:00 a.m. on the day DCF assigns (based on the first letter of your last name).
	There is no cash-back option available for SNAP benefits.
	The 36-month limit does not apply to SNAP benefits.

DENIED?

If you received a denial notice from the Kansas Department for Children and Families, you can appeal.

This brochure gives you tips on how to appeal if you receive a denial.

Guidebook&nbsp;on what to do if you are denied.

What types of things should you appeal?

You were denied benefits and:


	A notice that you were overpaid benefits, when you reported future income, like that you got a job, but you didn‚Äôt earn any money in the same month you got TANF.
	You were not able to complete a work requirement because the facility was closed and provided documentation to your caseworker.
	You were unable to meet your work requirement because childcare was needed and was not available to you.
	You are a single parent, with a child under 6 and childcare, from family or a facility, was not available to you.
	You have been receiving in home medical support services, which you dr. still says you need, but the KanCare provider has stopped or reduced those services.


There is usually a very short amount of time to submit your request for an appeal hearing.

You can use this form to appeal the decision:&nbsp;http://www.oah.ks.gov/request.htm.

You don‚Äôt have to use the form; you can just state that you want to appeal on a paper. You must sign the paper. You can mail it or deliver it in person. The form can go to your local DCF office or to:

Office of Administrative Hearings, 1020 S. Kansas Ave., Topeka, Kansas 66612.

If your appeal is denied, you may have to pay back the benefits you received during the appeal process.&nbsp;

Questions:

1. How do I know why I was denied?

DCF includes a ‚Äúdenial code‚Äù in the Notice of Action. ‚ÄúIncomplete application‚Äù means you need to provide additional documentation (maybe just a copy of a utility bill). Call your DCF office to follow up.

The rule number that applies to your situation is stated in the Notice of Action.

2. &nbsp;How do I know the rules for these programs?

Each program has a separate set of rules.&nbsp; The manual for the programs is available at:&nbsp;http://content.dcf.ks.gov/EES/KEESM/Current/Home.htm‚Äã.&nbsp;The manual for these programs is called the&nbsp;Kansas Economic and Employment Services Manual.&nbsp; The rules set out there should be used by the caseworker to make decisions about your case.&nbsp; The notice you received will list the sections of this manual that were used to make decisions in your case.&nbsp; You can look up the rules by number, using the index to the manual.

3. &nbsp;What happens if I file a request for appeal?

After your written notice is filed, you will receive a letter from the Office of Administrative Hearings.

The caseworker will be required to prepare an explanation of the reasons they took the action they did in your case.&nbsp; It will include the rules applied and the evidence used by the caseworker.&nbsp; You will receive a copy of that notice. Your appeal and evidence should be directed at proving the information used by the caseworker is not true or is not the complete situation.&nbsp;

You should make copies of any written evidence you have and send them to the Office of Hearings and Appeals and the case manager before the hearing.&nbsp; The Hearing Officer will have to decide if the evidence you and the caseworker present is valid evidence. &nbsp;

You will be able to tell your information under oath.

&nbsp;You can also bring witnesses to give information for you.&nbsp; If a witness won‚Äôt appear voluntarily, you can make a written request to the Office of Administrative Hearings to issue a subpoena to your witness.

You get one chance to provide evidence for your hearing.&nbsp; If a decision is made about the matter without the evidence you want to present, you won‚Äôt get a new hearing or have another chance.

The Hearing will be handled by a Hearing Officer, who works for the state, but not the Department for Children and Families (DCF).&nbsp;

You should understand that this person is going to make the decision in your case.&nbsp; You should be respectful of this person.&nbsp; The hearing will happen over the phone.&nbsp; You should try to provide a landline for this call or be certain that your cell phone is plugged in or fully charged.

The Hearing Officer will often want to have a phone call in advance of the hearing to try to understand the issues in your appeal.

You will get a written notice of this phone call.&nbsp; You should read the notice carefully to see if the call is the ‚Äúhearing‚Äù or a pre-hearing conference.&nbsp; Only the evidence presented during the hearing is officially considered by the Hearing Officer.

After you and the case manager present your ‚Äúevidence,‚Äù both written and testimony, the Hearing Officer will adjourn the hearing.&nbsp; They will make a written decision and send it to you and the DCF case manager.&nbsp;

If you don‚Äôt agree with that decision, you can appeal to the State committee, within 18 days.&nbsp;

You will not get another hearing or another chance to present evidence. This Board will review the evidence used by the Hearing Officer to make their decision.

389,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1959,State of Kansas ends $25 cap on cash benefits from ATMs,Public Benefits,TANF,TANF,"Department for Children and Families rescinded policy

Posted:&nbsp;August 4, 2015&nbsp; &nbsp;Topeka Capital-Journal&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;John Hanna&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Associated Press

Kansas has eliminated a $25-a-day limit on ATM withdrawals with cash assistance cards over concerns from U.S. officials about the much-criticized part of a larger effort to ensure that poor families use their benefits for necessities and not alcohol, gambling or luxuries such as concerts or tattoos.

The Kansas Department for Children and Families announced Tuesday, August 4, that it was rescinding the cap before it was put into effect for 15,000 poor residents receiving cash assistance each month.

Secretary Phyllis Gilmore said the state agency received an email Monday from a division of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, saying the limit appeared to prevent poor families from having ‚Äúadequate access‚Äù to their benefits.

U.S. officials had questions weeks ago about how the limit would affect poor families.

Legislators approved the limit on ATM withdrawals in April as part of a broader measure rewriting rules for cash assistance. Copies of emails obtained by The Associated Press through an open records request show U.S. officials had questions weeks ago about how the limit would affect poor families. In June, state lawmakers passed a follow-up measure giving Gilmore the authority to raise or rescind the limit.

The cap was aimed at preventing recipients from converting their benefits to cash to get around limits on how the assistance could be used. But even some Republican lawmakers who support a limit acknowledged that $25 ‚Äî set during a Senate debate ‚Äî was too low.

Gilmore noted her agency didn‚Äôt propose the $25 limit. DCF officials have been trying for weeks to assess whether U.S. officials opposed it enough to threaten to withhold more than $100 million in federal welfare funds from Kansas.

‚ÄúIt was distracting from the good parts of the law,‚Äù said state Sen. Michael O‚ÄôDonnell, a Wichita Republican who supported a $60-per-day limit and said lawmakers might reconsider the issue next year.

The first welfare measure included a list of items for which benefits couldn‚Äôt be used and places where cash assistance can‚Äôt be spent. The list remains in place and includes alcohol, tobacco, gambling and sexually oriented materials, as well as entertainment. Cash assistance also can‚Äôt be used in nail salons or spas, on cruise ships or at tattoo or body-piercing parlors.

‚ÄúAlthough there is no ATM withdrawal limit in place, we encourage clients to use their assistance for necessities as they work toward self-sufficiency,‚Äù Gilmore said in a statement.

Critics argue such policies are punitive.

They said the cap on ATM withdrawals would force families to make many trips to ATMs a month and incur fees each time to pay expenses such as rent or utility bills.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see that the federal agency has weighed in quickly so that we avoid unnecessary costs and unnecessary burdens for Kansas families,‚Äù said Shannon Cotsoradis, president and CEO of Kansas Action for Children.

Kansas DCF officials had said it would take up to a year to make the technical changes with cash assistance cards to enforce the ATM limit. They submitted a new plan for the program last week to HHS officials for their review.

But the copies of emails between Kansas and regional HHS officials obtained through the records request showed the HHS officials had questions about the ATM policy within days of Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signing the first welfare legislation.

A state official sent an email April 23 to regional HHS officials replying to questions ‚Äúabout access to benefits for payment of rent.‚Äù A regional HHS official‚Äôs May 7 email asked what Kansas would do to ensure poor families had enough places at which to withdraw benefits ‚Äúwith minimal fees or charges,‚Äù expressing concern about a potential ‚Äúdearth‚Äù of rural locations.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Myths and misconceptions about public assistance in Kansas and what living in poverty actually means in Kansas.


Public assistance includes government benefits provided to individuals and families living at or near the federal poverty level.&nbsp;

SNAP

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is federally funded to provide low income individuals and households with access to healthy foods and a nutritionally adequate diet.

Do people spend their SNAP/TANF assistance on ‚Äòluxury‚Äô items?&nbsp;

In 2014,&nbsp;Kansas spent $40,000 drug testing 2,783 TANF applicants. Only 11 applicants tested positive for drug use. The maximum assistance amount each of those individuals would have been receiving in cash assistance would have been $267 per month, meaning this investigation only saved the state $35,244. The state lost money on these investigations.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Do people sell their benefits for drugs? &nbsp;I‚Äôve heard many assistance recipients are drug users. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Recipients are not able to use their SNAP funds on alcohol, tobacco, non-food items, vitamins, or prepared foods. &nbsp; &nbsp;

TANF recipients are not able to use funds on a large variety of things. &nbsp;

Are people receiving assistance lazy? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

68% of food insecure households in Kansas have one or more full-time workers.&nbsp;

SNAP participants who are not working are only exempt from work requirements due either to age, disability, or other specific reasons.

Able-bodied adults without dependents, those age 18-49, must meet work requirements to qualify for SNAP, working at least 80 hours per month and, if he or she does not meet the work requirements, the individual is only eligible for up to 3 months of assistance

Do public assistance programs provide enough money for people to live on?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

The average combined SNAP and TANF benefit per individual was $112 per month, or $247 per household in Kansas in 2014.&nbsp; 

Welfare recipients still live at or below the federal poverty level.


	In July 2015, every state‚Äôs TANF benefits for a family of 3 with no other cash income was below 50% of the federal poverty level (FPL), with most states being below 30% ‚Äì that‚Äôs a yearly income of $6,027.&nbsp; &nbsp;
	In Kansas, the maximum TANF benefits a person can receive puts him or her at 20-30% FPL.
	83% of families receiving TANF in Kansas consistently receive SNAP benefits and, with these benefits combined, still live at 55% FPL. In a family of 3, that is $10,045 per year.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 


Are tax dollars are going to waste?&nbsp;

Every $1 provided by SNAP generates $1.70 of economic activity in Kansas

SNAP benefits contributed about $374 million into the Kansas economy in 2015.

I‚Äôve heard the number of public assistance recipients in Kansas is decreasing because fewer Kansans are living in poverty ‚Äì is that true?

TANF enrollment has decreased by more than 23,000 individuals,&nbsp;mostly children, since Governor Brownback took office in 2011, yet the poverty rate has continued to rise in Kansas, and more and more children are receiving free and reduced price meals in the state. This indicates that while TANF enrollment is decreasing, Kansas families are still struggling.&nbsp; &nbsp;


	
	TANF enrollment fell by 54% between 2011 and 2014 and the number of low-income parents ‚Äì mostly single mothers ‚Äì dropped by 27%, but more than 50% of children qualify for free or subsidized meals, meaning they live in a household with an income below 130% FPL or between 131-185% for reduced price meals. &nbsp; &nbsp;

Lots of money flows at tax time. And everyone wants a piece of it. Be smart and keep all of your refund. Here are our simple tips for holding onto your hard-earned money.

If you make an annual salary of $60,000 or less, try&nbsp;&nbsp;MyFreeTaxes.com&nbsp;online filing.&nbsp;Keep 100% of your refund by saving an average of $200 or more in tax preparation fees.

Tip #1: Say ""No"" to money advances: rapid refunds, ""Money Now"" loans, and other ""fast money"" products.


Many commercial tax preparers love to sell ""rapid refunds."" Don't bite!

These offers are really high-interest short-term loans with outrageously high interest rates - ranging from 50% to over 500% APR. Worse yet, with electronic filing, these offers don't deliver your refund that much faster. Typically, they will speed up your refund by only a week or two, depending on your situation.

Some tax preparers are switching to ""prepaid"" lines of credit. Again, be careful! Waiting a few days for your tax return can be a much better deal.

If you fall for these schemes, you are giving away a chunk of your refund to a money lender. Keep all of your hard-earned money and tax credits for yourself and your family. You deserve it!&nbsp;Say ""No""&nbsp;to all forms of up-front tax refund and loan offers.

According to the&nbsp;Center&nbsp;for Responsible Lending,&nbsp;a study found that lenders stripped about$738 million&nbsp;in loan fees from&nbsp;8.4 million&nbsp;taxpayers in 2008. If you don't want to be a part of this statistic,&nbsp;just say ""No!""

Learn more about ""rapid refund"" loans by learning about Signs of a Predatory Tax Refund Loan.


Tip #2: Get free tax filing help in your area.


Qualified volunteers offer&nbsp;free&nbsp;tax filing help to low-income Kansans.&nbsp;

Check out these free tax help programs:

AARP Tax-Aide&nbsp;To find the site nearest you, use AARP's&nbsp;&nbsp;online search tool&nbsp;or call&nbsp;1-888-687-2277&nbsp;

VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) IRS-Sponsored Program

&nbsp;Go to list of help sites on the IRS website&nbsp;or call the IRS at&nbsp;1-800-906-9887&nbsp;

VITA and AARP Tax-Aide services have better error rates (make fewer mistakes) than many commercial tax preparers. Many sites offer free e-filing, some offer home visits, if needed, and some offer help in languages other than English.

Another way to find a free tax filing center near you is to call&nbsp;211, or use the 211 Kansas website to&nbsp;search for free tax sites here.

In addition, the IRS provides&nbsp;Taxpayer Assistance Centers&nbsp;at a few locations. There are three in Kansas: Overland Park, Topeka and Wichita.


Tip #3: Or file for free online.


If you make an annual salary of $60,000 or less, try&nbsp;&nbsp;MyFreeTaxes.com&nbsp;online filing.&nbsp;Keep 100% of your refund by saving an average of $200 or more in tax preparation fees. You can file both federal and state taxes on this site.

The&nbsp;State of Kansas&nbsp;has a&nbsp;direct online ""I-file"" program&nbsp;for state income tax returns.Or visit the IRS site for&nbsp;links to other free online filing options.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each provider sets its own eligibility rules for its free filing program, so it's worth exploring several sites to see if you qualify. (If you use one of these sites, be careful about pop-up ads and add-on fees. Remember:&nbsp;Just say ""No!"")

According to the site, this Guide will help you to:


	Determine if you are required to file a tax return;
	Determine which form or forms you should file;
	Understand the filing instructions; and
	Prepare and submit your own federal tax forms.



Tip #4: Claim all of the tax credits for which you qualify.

The following five credits can be especially valuable to low income taxpayers:

Earned Income Credit (EIC)

The Earned Income Credit (EIC) for low-income taxpayers keeps growing. For tax year 2014, the maximum credit for a household with three or more children is&nbsp;$6,143. That can be money in your pocket!&nbsp;The IRS has reported that several million households are leaving billions unclaimed. So don't forget to claim this credit if you are eligible.&nbsp;Read more.

Get an estimate of the amount you could get from the Earned Income Credit now!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's easy.

Learn more about the Earned Income Tax Credit by watching this&nbsp;Legal Aid of Nebraska video.

&nbsp;Child Tax Credit

&nbsp;This is a partially refundable credit worth up to&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;for each child up to age 17. You must earn at least $3,000 in taxable income to be eligible.&nbsp;Read more&nbsp;

Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit

&nbsp;This credit is offered by both the state and federal governments. It is worth only a portion of your total child care costs, and there are caps. But the state credit is ""refundable,"" meaning that you can claim it (up to $500) even if you pay little or no tax.

Educational Tax Credits (the American Opportunity Tax Credit)&nbsp;

&nbsp;This educational credit can be worth as much as $2,500 for students who are in their first four years of college. The credit is for your tuition, educational materials, and some computer or internet expenses. See the IRS website for more&nbsp;information about what expenses qualify. &nbsp;You must meet certain income requirements. However, you may be eligible for a partial refund of up to $1,000 even if you do not owe taxes. Immigrants who are residents may also claim this credit. For more information,&nbsp;see the IRS website.

Tip #5: Say ""NO"" to tax scammers.&nbsp;

Did you receive an e-mail from the IRS asking for your personal information? Watch out! That letter is a scam. Learn more about how to spot a scam and how to protect yourself by watching this video from the IRS.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS answered by the IRS

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

What You Need to Know if You Get a Letter in the Mail from the IRS

Each year, the IRS mails millions of notices and letters to taxpayers for a variety of reasons. If you receive correspondence from the IRS:


	Don‚Äôt panic. You can usually deal with a notice simply by responding to it.
	Most IRS notices are about federal tax returns or tax accounts. Each notice has specific instructions, so read your notice carefully because it will tell you what you need to do.
	Your notice will likely be about changes to your account, taxes you owe or a payment request. However, your notice may ask you for more information about a specific issue.
	If your notice says that the IRS changed or corrected your tax return, review the information and compare it with your original return.
	If you agree with the notice, you usually don‚Äôt need to reply unless it gives you other instructions or you need to make a payment.
	If you don‚Äôt agree with the notice, you need to respond. Write a letter that explains why you disagree, and include information and documents you want the IRS to consider. Mail your response with the contact stub at the bottom of the notice to the address on the contact stub. Allow at least 30 days for a response.
	For most notices, you won‚Äôt need to call or visit a walk-in center. If you have questions, call the phone number in the upper right-hand corner of the notice. Be sure to have a copy of your tax return and the notice with you when you call.
	Always keep copies of any notices you receive with your tax records.
	Be alert for&nbsp;tax scams. The IRS sends letters and notices by mail. We don‚Äôt contact people by email or social media to ask for personal or financial information. If you owe tax, you have several&nbsp;payment options. The IRS won‚Äôt demand that you pay a certain way, such as prepaid debit or credit card.
	For more on this topic, visit IRS.gov. Click on the link ‚ÄòResponding to a Notice‚Äô at the bottom center of the home page. Also, see&nbsp;Publication 594, The IRS Collection Process. You can get it on&nbsp;IRS.gov/forms&nbsp;at any time.


If you need to make a payment visit&nbsp;IRS.gov/payments&nbsp;or use the&nbsp;IRS2Go&nbsp;app to make payment with&nbsp;Direct Pay&nbsp;for free, or by debit or credit card through an approved payment processor for a fee.

Each and every taxpayer has a set of fundamental rights they should be aware of when dealing with the IRS. These are your&nbsp;Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Explore your rights and our obligations to protect them on IRS.gov.

Types of Cases Handled by Kansas Legal Services' Low Income Taxpayer Clinic

Innocent Spouse Relief Requests

Have you gotten a bill from the IRS for taxes from a joint tax return? Do you believe it would be unfair to hold you liable for these taxes? Depending on your circumstances, your knowledge of the debt, and other factors, such as spouse abuse, you may qualify for relief as an innocent spouse.

We can help you apply for Innocent Spouse Relief and can represent you if the IRS has denied this relief.

Identity Theft

Have you been told you failed to report income that you know you never earned? You may be a victim of identity theft. The Clinic may be able to help you.

Injured Spouse Claims

Have your taxes been withheld to pay a debt you do not owe, such as a defaulted student loan or a child support debt? If you filed a joint return and you had your own income and tax payments on the tax return (tax withholdings, earned income tax credit or additional child tax credit), you may have some relief. The spouse who did not owe the debt may request her portion of the tax refund.

The Clinic can help you file the Injured Spouse Claim and can represent you if the&nbsp;IRS has denied the claim.

Audits or Examinations

&nbsp;Have you received a letter from the IRS telling you that your tax return is being audited or examined?

The letter may say that the IRS is reviewing your filing status, such as head of household, or certain claimed deductions or credits (dependency exemptions, business deductions,earned income tax credit, child tax credit or childcare credit). We can prepare evidence requested by the auditor, file a request to reconsider, attend meetings with IRS employees on your behalf, or represent you during an audit.

Debt Cancellation

Have you lost your home to foreclosure? The IRS treats forgiven debt as income. We can assist you in determining if that income is taxable.

Earned Income Tax&nbsp;Credit Appeals

The IRS audits many earned income tax credit (EITC) returns. Have you received a letter from the IRS that your earned income tax credit has been denied?

If the IRS determines that the error was reckless or intentional, you cannot claim the EITC for the next two years. If the IRS finds that the error was fraud, you cannot claim the EITC for the next ten years. We can help you appeal the EITC denial and keep your right to claim the EITC in the future.

Deficiency Notices/Tax Court

Have you received a notice from the IRS that there is a ""deficiency"" in your taxes and that you have 90 days to file a petition to the Tax Court? If you do not file within that time, you lose the right to go to court without first paying the tax. We can help you settle the matter or file a petition to Tax Court.

Liens and Levies

Have you received a notice that the IRS plans to file a lien on your property for past taxes, or a notice that it will levy on your property or garnish your wages? We can help with the lien or levy. We can help you ask for a Collections Due Process Hearing to determine whether the IRS can place a levy on your property.

Negotiations and/or&nbsp;Settlements

Are you unable to pay your tax debt? We may be able to help you with the following options:


	
	enter into an installment or payment agreement;
	
	
	place your account in currently not collectible status;
	
	
	make an offer in compromise (settlement) offer;
	
	
	request a taxpayer assistance order if you have a hardship;
	
	
	request temporary suspension of collection, or;
	
	
	challenge the tax if the time period has not expired or proper procedure was not followed.
	


Employee/Independent&nbsp;Contractor Disputes

Do you have a dispute about whether you are an employee or an independent contractor? You may owe a lot of self-em-ployment taxes. We can help you ask the IRS to change your employment status.

380,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1948,Analysis questions fairness of Kansas tax system,Poverty,"taxes
poverty",Taxation,"Group‚Äôs research counters Brownback claim that ‚Äòall Kansans‚Äô paying less because of 2012 income tax cuts

By&nbsp;Jim McLean&nbsp;| June 22, 2015 &nbsp; Kansas Health Institute

Kansas already had the ninth-most regressive tax system in the nation, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

The tax increase signed last week by Gov. Sam Brownback to balance the budget and end the longest legislative session in state history&nbsp;will make the system less fair to low- and middle-income Kansans, said Matt Gardner, executive director of the nonpartisan but left-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C.

&nbsp;



‚ÄúThe tax changes the Legislature has just enacted do very little to fix what was wrong with the last two rounds of tax changes,‚Äù Gardner said, referring to the income tax cuts and sales tax hikes&nbsp;passed in 2012&nbsp;and&nbsp;2013.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs generally recognized that the (income tax) cuts that were passed a few years ago at Brownback‚Äôs behest didn‚Äôt pay for themselves,‚Äù Gardner said.

‚ÄúThey were unaffordable and they were unfair.‚Äù

Regressive tax systems rely more on sales and excise taxes and less on income taxes. That,&nbsp;according to the ITEP analysis, taxes the bottom 20 percent of taxpayers at effective rates up to seven times higher than wealthy taxpayers. Middle-income families pay effective rates up to three times higher, according to the report.

Download the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy Report: Who Pays?

Gardner said if Kansas lawmakers wanted to solve the state‚Äôs budget problems and improve the fairness of its tax system, they should have revisited the 2012 tax cuts rather than increasing sales and cigarette taxes. In particular, he said, they should have reinstated income taxes on more than 330,000 business owners whose pass-through and passive earnings were exempted by the 2012 law.

‚ÄúYou would think that fixing what‚Äôs wrong with the Kansas tax system would start with that,‚Äù he said.

Rep. Mark Hutton, a Wichita Republican, spearheaded an effort to reinstate taxes on that business income but&nbsp;gave up the fight in the session‚Äôs final days&nbsp;when he and others couldn‚Äôt convince Brownback to back off a veto threat.

An ITEP analysis of all the state‚Äôs tax changes enacted since 2012, including&nbsp;this year‚Äôs tax package, shows that the poorest Kansans ‚Äî those with an average income of $13,000 ‚Äî will pay an average of $197 more per year in taxes while the wealthiest 1 percent will pay an average of $24,632 less.

Brownback has said that the recently passed tax package is not a tax increase.

At a news conference last week, and&nbsp;in several interviews since, Brownback has said that the recently passed tax package is not a tax increase. He contends that when taken as a whole, the tax changes enacted since 2012 represent a tax cut.

‚ÄúSome would have you believe this bill represents a tax increase, and that is not accurate,‚Äù Brownback said. ‚ÄúWhen looked at in totality from 2012 to 2015, Kansans are paying less in taxes and continuing to move off income taxes to consumption-based taxes. The net of it is over a $300 million tax cut ‚Ä¶ for all Kansans.‚Äù

The ITEP analysis shows that even with the recent changes, approximately 60 percent of Kansas taxpayers will pay less than they did prior to the 2012 tax cuts. However, the bottom 40 percent will pay more, even though the tax package, starting in 2017, exempts more than 380,000 low-income Kansans from the income tax.

Gardner said many of the low-income Kansans exempted by the bill had little or no income tax liability as it was, in large part because of the tax credits for which they qualified. He said exempting them was little more than a ‚ÄúPR stunt‚Äù to make the tax package appear less regressive.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty insulting to low-income families to claim that increasing the income tax threshold is going to provide meaningful assistance to them,‚Äù Gardner said.

‚ÄúThe bottom line is that low-income families are seeing a big tax hike as a result of this year‚Äôs legislative agreement.‚Äù

Kansas Revenue Secretary Nick Jordan said the department hasn‚Äôt yet calculated the average income tax liability of those being exempted. But, he said, ‚ÄúThey had a tax liability.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe misinformation out there is that most of these people didn‚Äôt pay taxes anyway,‚Äù Jordan said. ‚ÄúEven after they did all the tax credits, they still had a tax liability and they‚Äôre now going to zero.‚Äù

420,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/2016,Three tips to help you make the most of your tax refund,Taxation,,Taxation,"&nbsp;

BY&nbsp;DAVE SIEMINSKI&nbsp; February, 2016 &nbsp;U. S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

&nbsp;

If you &nbsp;have a hard time saving money, you are not alone.

About 34 percent of adults in the US‚Äîabout 72 million people‚Äîreport having no emergency savings.

Also, 47 percent of American adults say they wouldn‚Äôt have enough savings to last three months if they lost their source of income.

Even if you find saving hard, an emergency fund can help when you have money problems. Households facing an emergency without savings are more prone to long-term setbacks, such as food and housing insecurity.

For many people, making ends meet through the year is tough, and saving regularly may seem too hard.

So if you‚Äôre getting a tax refund, why not consider saving some of it?

You can use the tax refund to build an emergency fund or start a nest egg. Whatever your savings goal, now is a great time to start.

Tax season is short, so you should start thinking now about how you‚Äôll prepare your taxes. Here are some tips to help you navigate the filing process and make the most of your refund.

1. Direct deposit can help you save

Did you know that receiving your refund through direct deposit puts you in a better position to save?

By setting up direct deposit when you file your return, the IRS will automatically send your refund to up to three separate accounts without you having to touch it.

You can put some money in checking to take care of your immediate expenses and put the rest in savings.&nbsp;

Check with the IRS for more information on direct deposit and splitting your refund.

2. You can file your taxes for free

If your income is $54,000 or less, if you are 60 years old or older, or if you have a disability or speak limited English, you can generally get free tax preparation assistance at a&nbsp;Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) location near you.&nbsp;This IRS checklist can help you gather your information for tax year 2015. &nbsp;This page on this website gives you information about places to get taxes filed for free.

If you decide to do it yourself:


	If your income is $62,000 or less, you can use any one of several major tax preparation software products, offered through the&nbsp;IRS Free File Alliance, to prepare and file your return for free. If your income is more than $62,000, you can still&nbsp;download free tax filing forms&nbsp;through the IRS.



	There are many easy-to-use tax preparation software products on the market that will help you walk through the tax filing process step-by-step.
	These are not free but they may be less expensive than paying someone to file your return for you.


Tip:&nbsp;Depending on your age, income, and filing status,&nbsp;you might not technically be required to file&nbsp;a return ‚Äì but it might still be a good idea. You might receive a tax refund, or you might be eligible for tax credits.

3. Be aware of potential tax fraud

Tax fraud is becoming more and more common.

From 2011 through 2013, the IRS stopped 14.6 million suspicious returns. But, there are several steps you can take to protect yourself from fraud.


	Stay alert for scam phone calls.&nbsp;The IRS will not:

	
		Call or email you to ask for personal information.
		Demand immediate payment without first sending you a bill in the mail and giving you an opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.
		Require you use a specific payment method for taxes, like a prepaid debit card.
		Ask for credit card information over the phone.
		Threaten to have you arrested for not paying.
	
	


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any of these things happen to you, report it to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 1.800.366.4484 or at&nbsp;treasury.gov/tigta.


	File electronically&nbsp;and request that your refund be deposited directly into your account.



	Use ID theft prevention measures.&nbsp;


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don‚Äôt carry your social security card with you and don‚Äôt give it out just because a business or professional asks for it. Also, don‚Äôt carry your Medicare card unless you‚Äôre going to a doctor for the first time.


	Check your credit report.&nbsp;


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can review your credit report for free every 12 months at AnnualCreditReport.com, or by calling 877-322-8228.


	If you suspect you‚Äôve been a victim of identity theft&nbsp;and it involves your income tax return,&nbsp;the IRS has more information and help on suspected fraud.

429,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/2031,Getting Right with Your Taxes: The IRS answers some questions,Taxation,"irs
income taxes",Taxation,"Frequently Asked Questions

QUESTION: Two years ago, I worked 2 months but never Ô¨Åled a federal tax return and do not have any documents to show that I worked. What should I do?

ANSWER: If your former employer cannot provide the information, you should request a copy of your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, or Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, from the IRS for the year you worked. There are several options to obtain this information: download Form 4506-T from www.irs.gov, call 1-800-829-1040, or visit the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center near you. Once you receive all of the forms, you can take advantage of one of the free resources to Ô¨Åle your return.

QUESTION: How do I get a copy of a tax return I previously Ô¨Åled?

ANSWER: There are several options. The IRS can provide a tax return transcript for many returns free of charge. The transcript provides most of the line entries from the original tax return and usually contains the information that a third party (such as a mortgage company) requires. To request a transcript online, go to www.irs.gov and click on the ‚ÄúOrder a Transcript‚Äù tool. To order by phone, call 1-800-908-9946 and follow the prompts in the recorded message. To order by mail or fax, use Form 4506-T, Request for Transcript of Tax Return.

If you need a copy of your Form 1040 and all attachments as originally submitted to the IRS, use Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return. There is a fee for each return when using this form.

QUESTION: I owe the IRS money for back taxes. I cannot pay the money. What should I do?

ANSWER: The Ô¨Årst thing you should to do is call 1-800-829-1040 and talk to a customer representative. He or she will discuss your payment options based on your current Ô¨Ånancial situation. Several options are available to you including:


	An Installment Agreement to pay off the balance due over a speciÔ¨Åed period of time.
	An Offer in Compromise which allows you to make an offer of a lesser amount. If the amount is accepted by IRS you will not owe the rest of the money unless you do not continue to meet future Ô¨Åling requirements.
	If it is determined that your current Ô¨Ånancial situation does not allow you to make payments, they may temporarily suspend collection on the account, however interest and the failure-to-pay penalty continue to accrue.


QUESTION: What if I believe I do not owe the amount the IRS states that I owe?

ANSWER: You can contact 1-800-829-1040 to discuss how the IRS calculated your balance due. If a discrepancy exists, the representative will advise you how to correct it. You may need to Ô¨Åle an amended return, an appeal, or take some other action. If you cannot get the matter resolved and need additional help you can contact the Taxpayer Advocate OfÔ¨Åce (1-877-777-4778) or a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (Kansas Legal Services operates a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic -- click here).

QUESTION: My employer is paying me cash and I do not get any pay stubs or tax documents. What should I do about my taxes?

ANSWER: Generally, payments you receive for providing services are taxable and should be included in your income unless speciÔ¨Åcally exempted by law. Income that is taxable must be reported on your return and is subject to tax even if your employer does not provide you with tax documents, such as a Form W-2. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information.

QUESTION: My employer is not withholding income taxes from my wages. What should I do?

ANSWER: If no income tax is withheld from your wages, you may owe tax at the end of the year, or risk owing penalties for paying too little tax upfront. If you submitted a Form W-4, Employee‚Äôs Withholding Allowance CertiÔ¨Åcate, when you started working, your employer should be using the information from this form to determine the amount of federal income tax to withhold from your pay. You may want to use the IRS Withholding Calculator on www.irs.gov to help you Ô¨Ågure out the amount you should be having withheld and see if you need to submit a new Form W-4 to your employer. Visit www.irs.gov or call 1-800-829-3676 to get a copy of Form W-4.

If the business you do work for did not ask you to complete a Form W-4, then they are most likely treating you as an independent contractor and should give you a Form 1099-MISC at year end. Basically, this means that you‚Äôre self- employed and are responsible for paying all of your own taxes ‚Äì federal, state, social security and Medicare. You‚Äôll be expected to make estimated tax payments to the IRS every three months.

For additional information about worker classiÔ¨Åcation, refer to IRS Publication 1779, Independent Contractor or Employee. If you think you are being misclassiÔ¨Åed, a Form SS-8, Determination of Worker Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding, can be Ô¨Åled to ask the IRS to make a determination on your worker status for federal tax purposes. Visit www.irs.gov or call 1-800-829-3676 to get a copy of Form SS-8 or Publication 1779. For more information on worker classiÔ¨Åcation or Form SS-8, visit www.irs.gov or call 1-800-829-1040.

QUESTION: What are the beneÔ¨Åts of Ô¨Åling a tax return?

ANSWER: No one likes to pay taxes, but it is the price we all pay to live in this great nation. First, it is a legal obligation if your income meets the Ô¨Åling requirements. But there are also beneÔ¨Åts to Ô¨Åling. You may be entitled to certain tax credits (such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit) and receive a refund from these credits and the taxes withheld from your paychecks only if you Ô¨Åle a tax return. Filing provides proof of income for renting apartments, attending school, buying a car, home or other credit applications. Filing will also ensure that Social Security payments will be credited to your account timely, especially if you are self-employed. That way, you get all the retirement beneÔ¨Åts you are entitled to and your family is provided for Ô¨Ånancially upon your death. It‚Äôs not always easy, but you can get help when you need it, and you‚Äôll have peace of mind.

QUESTION: I have not Ô¨Åled tax returns for the last three years. Should I go back and Ô¨Åle those returns?

ANSWER: Generally, you have three years from the due date of the return to Ô¨Åle a claim for a refund. However, if you think you might owe, it‚Äôs important to understand the ramiÔ¨Åcations of not Ô¨Åling a past due return and the steps that the IRS will take. Taxpayers who don‚Äôt Ô¨Åle a past due tax return or contact the IRS are subject to the following:


	Penalties and interest will be assessed and will increase the amount of tax due.
	The IRS will Ô¨Åle a substitute return for you. But this return is based only on information the IRS has from other sources. Thus, if the IRS prepares this substitute return, it will not include any additional exemptions or expenses you may be entitled to and may overstate your real tax liability.
	Once the tax is assessed the IRS will start the collection process, which can include placing a levy on wages or bank accounts or Ô¨Åling a federal tax lien against your property.
	Even if the IRS has already Ô¨Åled a substitute return, it still makes sense for you to Ô¨Åle your own return to make sure you take advantage of all the exemptions, credits, and deductions you are allowed. The IRS will generally adjust your account to reÔ¨Çect the correct Ô¨Ågures.


QUESTION: I do not get my tax refund because it goes to pay my defaulted student loans. Why should I Ô¨Åle a return when I will never get my refund?

ANSWER: If you have past due child support, defaulted student loans or past-due state income tax obligations, your refund will be applied to these debts. It is better that you Ô¨Åle your return and pay down your student loan or other debt so that you can pay off the arrears instead of allowing it to continue to grow. The IRS is just a collection agent for these types of debts and does not have details on the status of these accounts or the ability to have the debt wiped out. The

Treasury Offset Program Call Center can give you additional information about these debts. You can reach them by calling 1-800-304-3107. The Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) can also answer your student loan questions. You can reach them by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243)

QUESTION: How do I know if I qualify for the EITC or another tax credit?

ANSWER: Eligibility for the EITC and other tax credits is determined based on a number of factors. To qualify, you must meet certain requirements and Ô¨Åle a tax return. The instructions for each form explain the rules for each credit. The rules can be complicated, so you should seek assistance if you are unsure of your eligibility. If you are in doubt about your eligibility, you should consult www.irs.gov or call 1-800-829-1040.

R15: Hasta que el&nbsp;ITIN&nbsp;est√© reactivado, las declaraciones presentadas con un&nbsp;ITIN&nbsp;vencido ser√°n tramitadas y tratadas como presentados oportunamente, pero ser√°n tramitadas sin ninguna exenci√≥n y/o cr√©dito que haya reclamado, y ning√∫n reembolso ser√° pagado en ese momento. El contribuyente recibir√° aviso del&nbsp;IRS&nbsp;que explica la demora en cualquier reembolso a que tenga derecho, y le informa de que tiene que reactivar el&nbsp;ITIN. Una vez que reactive el&nbsp;ITIN, cualquier exenci√≥n o cr√©dito ser√° tramitado, y cualquier reembolso a que tenga derecho le ser√° pagado. Si no reactiva el&nbsp;ITIN, el contribuyente podr√≠a estar sujeto a multas e intereses sobre el impuesto que adeuda como resultado de exenciones y cr√©ditos denegados.

464,http://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/2084,Individual Taxpayer Identification Number -- Form W7,Taxation,"ITIN
individual taxpayer identification number",Taxation,"This news is especially important for immigrants and non-residents who have an ITIN, please spread the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;Espa√±ol

ITIN stands for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number and&nbsp;allows anyone, regardless of immigration or residence status,&nbsp;to file a U.S. tax return if they do not have a social security number.

In their process of cleaning up ITINs, several ITINs expired on&nbsp;January 1, 2017.&nbsp; The IRS is trying to target specific ITINs based on a date range, but they are also including ITINS that were not used on the last 3 years of tax returns.

People can renew their ITINs &nbsp;by filling out a&nbsp;new Form W-7.

Some things that will cause concern:


	Some of the people they are trying to contact are those people who did not file tax returns in the last 3 years.&nbsp; As a result, the addresses the IRS has are 3 years old and are likely out of date so those people will not know the ITIN is expiring.
	The next tax return a person files will not be fully processed if they have an expired ITIN.&nbsp; It will be treated as timely filed, but they will not get exemptions or credits claimed, plus refunds will not be paid out until the individual has a new ITIN.
	Without renewing the ITIN, that person's tax return may be subject to interest and penalties because of those disallowed exemptions and credits.


This can wind up bringing major tax consequences for someone who decides not to renew their ITIN at any point in the process.

Many of those receiving the service once provided a service as members of the United States military.The U.S. Veterans Administration estimates there are 1,800 homeless veterans in the Kansas City area every night. That accounts for more than a third of the city's homeless population even though veterans represent only a tenth of the population as a whole, according to veterans' advocate Art Fillmore.""Some of these people are serving six, seven,&nbsp;eight tours and it creates a very dysfunctional atmosphere for their personal life when they come home,"" Fillmore said.Fillmore is a combat veteran of the Vietnam War. He was chairman of the foundation that gave Kansas City a Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Now he's on the board of a group working to provide permanent housing to homeless veterans.""In the past it's always been transitional housing,"" Fillmore explained. ""If somebody goes to a place where he or she can stay forever, with that thought in mind, they'll get a job, they'll feel like it's their place, they feel like they actually have a home.""Construction on the St. Michael's Veterans Center is set to begin in early 2013, on a 24-acre vacant lot just south of the VA Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri.&nbsp;It was once home to a public housing complex, which was demolished long ago and sat as a blighted dumping ground for years.The plan is to erect three apartment buildings, with 180 units total, plus a service center offering mental health services and job skills training, among other things.""If somebody goes to a place where he or she can stay forever, with that thought in mind, they'll get a job, they'll feel like it's their place, they feel like they actually have a home.""""This is going to be a place where the veterans are going to be a community,"" Fillmore said. ""We've nicknamed the project; we've given it the tag name 'The Homes&nbsp;for the Brave,' and that's what it is. It's people who have done their service for the country. They fulfilled their contract with America and America hasn't done its part for them, so we're going to try to fill that void.""Fillmore said the services are provided in other cities, but the centralized campus concept makes it unusual, possibly even unique.A city grant and state tax breaks are helping make the $34 million non-profit project possible. A memorial garden, called the ""Garden of Honor,"" will be funded entirely by private donations. The nonprofit, St. Michael's Veterans Center, Inc., will need to re-apply for grants each year, so it is split into three phases. Phase one involves the first 58 apartment units, the service center and the garden.

April, 2016 New Legal Assistance Program for Veterans and Active Military in Kansas City, Military Matters


Wounded Warriors Program for Kansas Veterans

The Wounded Warrior Project offers free support and services to about 60,000 Veterans across the country. The office at 7400 College Blvd. in Overland Park serves Veterans in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa.&nbsp;Read more about the Kansas program here.

The Wounded Warrior Project serves post-9/11 Veterans who were physically or mentally injured as part of their military service. That includes ‚Äúout of sight wounds‚Äù like PTSD and military sexual trauma as well as traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities.&nbsp;

All services are free to Veterans, their families and carers. The nonprofit Wounded Warrior Project began 10 years ago and is headquartered in Jacksonville, Fla. Its 2013 budget of nearly $219 million was all funded by private donations. Eighty percent of the budget went to providing services, 16 percent to fundraising and 4 percent to administrative costs.

Help for Veterans and their families going through homelessness

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Veterans are proven leaders. But they‚Äôre also human. Veterans&nbsp;can face money problems and mental health challenges, or retreat from family and friends as they adjust to civilian life. Don‚Äôt ignore the hardships that could risk the health, income, or homes of Veterans you know.

The U.S. Office of Veterans Affairs (VA) has set aside new resources for ending Veteran homelessness. For Veterans who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, VA is here to help.

Make the Call to&nbsp;877- 4AID-VET&nbsp;(877- 424 - 3838)&nbsp;or chat online at&nbsp;va.gov/homeless&nbsp;to help Veterans access the services they have earned.

There is no ‚Äútypical‚Äù Veteran. Your oldest buddy, the store clerk, the woman playing with her children at the park‚Äî they all may be Veterans at risk of homelessness. VA is committed to ending Veteran homelessness by the end of 2015. VA is able to do this because it provides a wide range of services to suited Veterans who are homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless, including:

‚Ä¢ Health care

‚Ä¢ Safe housing and temporary rental assistance

‚Ä¢ Job training and financial counseling

‚Ä¢ Help paying for child care or moving expenses

‚Ä¢ Foreclosure avoidance through guaranteed loans

These resources‚Äîand others provided by local agencies‚Äî have already helped thousands of Veterans. We are here to make sure that those who served our country get the help they need. But no one can end homelessness alone.

Ask anyone you meet who is dealing with homelessness if he or she is a Veteran. Free support is open 24/7 from the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at&nbsp;877- 4AID-VET. You can also visit the Homeless Veterans Download Center to access printable brochures, posters, and Web banners that can help you raise knowledge in our community at&nbsp;va.gov/homeless/resource_center.asp&nbsp;&nbsp;

wounded warriors",Veterans/Military,"Angie Peacock lost 40 pounds in two months from stress and dehydration while serving in Baghdad, but coming home to Missouri was also hell.

After she was medically retired from the Army, her isolation and depression deepened. Post-traumatic stress disorder. Substance abuse. Homelessness. Suicidal thoughts.

Now, the 35-year-old has her life back, and she credits a national organization that opened a Kansas City area office. (The picture is of Peacock and her service dog, G.I. Joe.)

The Wounded Warrior Project offers free support and services to about 60,000 Veterans across the country. The office at 7400 College Blvd. in Overland Park will serve about 1,700 Veterans in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa.

""I would have been dead.""

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here right now without them,‚Äù Peacock said at a welcoming event. ‚ÄúI would have been dead.‚Äù

Instead, she is now a mentor to other Veterans and is working on a degree in psychology from Washington University so she can be a licensed professional to work with PTSD patients.

‚ÄúI fought to get sober,‚Äù Peacock said. ‚ÄúI went through a divorce and bankruptcy. I lost everything and had to build myself back up.‚Äù

The Wounded Warrior Project serves post-9/11 Veterans who were physically or mentally injured as part of their military service. That includes ‚Äúinvisible wounds‚Äù like PTSD and military sexual trauma as well as traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities.

The group‚Äôs four main ‚Äúpillars,‚Äù or areas of focus, are mental health, physical health, economic empowerment and social engagement.

Service adds to VA services

The organization does not seek to supplant services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs but to augment them.

For example, a Veteran may receive therapy through the VA. But the Wounded Warrior Project offers a five-day ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù program that is like a retreat. Veterans may go whitewater rafting or do other activities with fellow Veterans while working on coping and interactive skills.

‚ÄúThere are things we can do to help fill the gaps for these warriors,‚Äù said Troy Brin, an alumni manager at the Kansas City office.

Veterans are referred to as alumni because it reflects that they have earned the services they are receiving.

In addition to providing peer support, the Wounded Warrior Project offers help with practical matters like applying for Veterans benefits and developing job interview skills.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to honor and empower ‚Äî not enable ‚Äî wounded warriors,‚Äù said Randy Plunkett, education initiatives director in the new Kansas City office.

Brin was in the Army for 20 years and served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before retiring. The Wounded Warrior Project helped him prepare for the job market, and he eventually got a job with the project itself.

Wounded Warrior services are free

All services are free to Veterans, their families and caregivers. The nonprofit Wounded Warrior Project began ten years ago and is headquartered in Jacksonville, FL. Its 2013 budget of nearly $219 million was entirely funded by private donations. Eighty percent of the budget went to providing services, 16 percent to fundraising and 4 percent to administrative costs.

Go to&nbsp;woundedwarriorproject.org&nbsp;for more information.

Before the Kansas City office opened, Brin worked out of the basement of his home in Gardner. Veterans often had to travel to other regions to receive help. An office here gives Veterans a central place to gather.

‚ÄúTo me it‚Äôs vitally important because now the alumni have a home,‚Äù Brin said. ‚ÄúThey can work on a resume or just sit and talk.‚Äù

Veterans are free to drop by the office, which is on the third floor of an office building, or to call 913-998-7522 during business hours.

Hope for even the most depressed

Peacock remembers how relieved she felt when she found the Wounded Warrior Project. Through it she learned that other people suffered as she did and that she belonged.

Veterans who have made progress with help from the project are encouraged to become ‚Äúpeer mentors‚Äù to other Veterans. Peacock has been doing that for the last three and a half years.

‚ÄúI see people change before my eyes by setting their own goals,‚Äù she said, noting there is hope for even the most depressed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate those of us who should be statistics.‚Äù

homelessness
Medical-Legal",Veterans/Military,"Posted by&nbsp;Ellen Lawton&nbsp; November 10, 2014 &nbsp;Huffington Post

There are many problems our nation's Veterans face as a result of serving our country that we must be prepared to treat when they return home. But homelessness should not be one of them; it is something that should never happen in the first place.

This Veterans Day,&nbsp;50,000 Veterans&nbsp;will sleep in shelters or on our streets.&nbsp;That number is down 23 percent between 2009 and 2013, thanks in part to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) investment in additional mental health counseling and&nbsp;subsidies for permanent housing&nbsp;from the VA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

We can prevent homelessness

But to get this number to zero, we have to stop thinking about homelessness as something we treat and start approaching it as something we can prevent. It will take recognizing the varying factors at the source of homelessness, cultivating a new kind of team - one that includes attorneys - to address those factors, and getting creative in developing cross sector partnerships.

Each year, the VA surveys homeless Veterans, VA staff and community service providers about the most significant unmet needs homeless Veterans face. This survey reveals that homelessness is about so much more than the lack of a place to sleep or even underlying mental health issues. Often an unaddressed legal problem triggers homelessness.

Veterans need legal assistance

In the VA's most recent survey, homeless Veterans reported needing legal help with evictions and foreclosures, outstanding criminal warrants and fines, child support issues that garnish wages, and a discharge status from the military that prevents employment. Homeless Veterans also reported needing legal help to access public benefits, secure guardians or fiduciaries, clear up bad credit, and expunge criminal records. Each of these barriers to employment and income jeopardize long-term housing.

Similar to mental health issues, when legal issues go ""untreated,"" they get worse and can affect every area of someone's life. These legal problems can also threaten to derail the success of other housing interventions as well as the well-intentioned efforts of healthcare and social service providers to help. Take the VA's housing voucher program as an example. If a Veteran has a bad credit score or lacks basic amenities like a refrigerator to furnish a rental property, she can be disqualified from using a voucher. And a homeless Veteran's inability to pay first, last and security deposit - a requirement that stands for most landlords - can also disqualify her from using a voucher.

Barriers to housing and wellness

These barriers can make it that much harder for a homeless Veteran to get a home. And since stable, healthy housing is a prerequisite for good health, these barriers pose challenges to a healthcare system charged with the responsibility of helping Veterans lead honorable, healthy lives.

But each of the situations described above can be resolved with the help of an attorney. And done early enough, legal interventions can assist with employment, boost income, and protect existing housing before a Veteran becomes homeless, and ensure that other interventions like a housing voucher work. But understanding the connection between legal problems and homelessness is the first step. How do we translate this knowledge to effective, preventive interventions?

Medical-Legal Partnerships

In recent years, an upstream approach known as ""Medical-Legal Partnership"" has arisen to help at-risk populations by combining and leveraging the strengths and resources of healthcare and civil legal aid providers. To date,&nbsp;262 healthcare institutions in 36 states&nbsp;have implemented this approach.

We have an opportunity to bring the legal aid and VA healthcare systems - which each hold critical pieces of the puzzle - together in a real way that looks at the whole person. Legal assistance is often the intervention needed, but traditionally,&nbsp;people do not typically seek out a lawyer unless they are in crisis, like when they have already been evicted. Alternatively, people frequent their healthcare institutions with much more regularity, providing healthcare with greater ability to detect problems more upstream.

VA encourages legal aid presence in medical centers

The good news is that the VA has made significant steps in this direction. The VA encourages its medical centers, outpatient clinics and Vet Centers to provide space for civil legal aid providers to address the legal needs of veterans; currently,&nbsp;43 VA healthcare facilities provide office space for on-site civil legal services. That is a great start, but it needs to go further. We need more integration and wider adoption of this upstream approach.

We can start by training VA healthcare providers to screen for potentially harmful legal issues as part of their care for Veterans at risk of homelessness. And we can do more to ensure that every VA healthcare facility has a strong medical-legal partnership, forged with local, nonprofit civil legal aid agencies where not only are appropriate referrals made for services, but where civil legal aid is offered on-site, where communication between healthcare and legal teams is constant, and where both sides work together to improve policies that impact the lives of Veterans who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness.

As we pause today to honor the men and women who have served our country with parades and speeches, and as you look through the compelling appeals you have no doubt received from Veterans' organizations, stop and ask yourself, can the medical-legal partnership approach work in your community? What other upstream solutions can help prevent homelessness? And what will it take from you, and from all of us, to make them happen?

Pro Bono
volunteers",Veterans/Military,"By Joe Pilgrim &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the Journal of the Kansas Bar Association July-August 2015

I frequently get asked a fair question: why should I help a Veteran with free legal services? I have my own personal reasons, and I think that question is better answered by the person volunteering his or her time. Whether it‚Äôs patriotism, a desire to give ‚Äúthanks,‚Äù or a feeling of responsibility to the community, attorneys volunteer their time for different reasons. One thing that continues to push me when I feel tired, frustrated, or I wonder if I‚Äôm really making a difference is this: I‚Äôm glad the Veteran that I‚Äôm providing legal services to standing before me did not give up when he or she may have felt the same way while defending our country. Now that may sound corny, but it does not change the nature of those Veterans‚Äô military service and the freedoms that we enjoy as a result of that service. Some Veterans need legal assistance and cannot afford it, which for many creates a sense of responsibility for&nbsp;giving back.

This need is not being ignored by people in the Topeka community. Marilyn Harp, the executive director of Kansas Legal Services (KLS), spoke to law students at Washburn University School of Law this year about how they could become involved in the effort to address what she called the ‚Äújustice gap‚Äù ‚Äì the gap that exists between those that need and cannot afford legal assistance and our current ability to provide such services. Through KLS and AmeriCorps, fellow law student Nikki Southall and I were able to provide legal services to Veterans last summer. We provided over 650 hours of pro bono legal services through KLS on issues such as divorce, landlord tenant, wills, pro se filing and representation, document preparation and review, general legal information, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (a deploying service member federal job protection law), and other assistance. But resources are limited at KLS, so there are only so many clients that can be helped there.

I have been told by more than one person that Veterans are not special&nbsp;

Washburn Law also has been dedicated to‚Äîand continues to assist‚ÄîVeterans in our area. Professor Lynette Petty, who teaches in the Washburn Law Clinic, is spearheading an effort to provide estate planning services to Veterans living in Kansas. By the time that this article is published, Washburn Law will have provided four Veterans Legal Assistance Clinics to Veterans in the community offering wills, living wills, durable powers of attorney, and health care directives through&nbsp;volunteer students, faculty, and staff, namely Debi Schrock, Curtis Waugh, John Francis, and Janet Jackson, as well as others. I am honored to be a part of that program and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the faculty who provide legal services to Veterans in our community. But just as at KLS, resources are limited at Washburn University School of Law, leaving a continued need for Kansas lawyers to volunteer.

I have been told by more than one person that Veterans are not special and they should not be treated any differently than anyone else; why do something for them for free? I have only one response to that: not every Veteran volunteered to be in the military. The draft is a real thing and although not currently in use, large numbers of our citizens were forced to do the unthinkable for our freedom. I do realize that the draft is no longer employed; however, there are other recruiting practices that prey on the lesser advantaged in our society and those practices can have a coercive effect on a person‚Äôs choice of whether to continue to live in poverty or to join the U.S. military and serve his or her country.

I am asking you as an attorney to volunteer four hours of one day, just one time this year

I am asking you as an attorney to volunteer four hours of one day, just one time this year to assist a Veteran with their legal issues. This can be in the form of document preparation, review of a simple divorce, preparing a will, or anything else that is needed. Some attorneys want to give back to Veterans but do not know how. I can tell you personally, as a Veteran, that it means the world to us when you do take the time to assist us. Please make the time for those of us who have given so much for you. Assisting us in engaging the legal system enables us to move past those barriers that may seem small to others, but are huge impediments to Veterans who might already be disenfranchised by a system they feel jaded toward. Marilyn Harp has stated that in several locations around the state, KLS does training on general powers of attorney, accessing the online forms that can be prepared on the KLS &nbsp;website, and general information. She also stated that KLS can package an hour of ethics for the training, with some CLE credit for the time spent actually participating in a pro bono clinic. She said that if people are interested in learning about those opportunities in their area they should contact Cindy VanHoutan at cindyv@klsinc.org to get on the email list used&nbsp;to publicize the opportunities.

To those of you who already give of your valuable time, thank you very much for what you have done and continue to do. Your efforts in assisting Veterans is greatly appreciated by those of us who have served. All gave some, some gave all; please give back to those who have given so much for you.&nbsp;

From GardnerEdge.com

On Wednesday, January 13, Johnson County District Court held the first Veterans Treatment Court in Kansas. The mission of the VTC is to identify Veterans in the criminal justice system and, when eligible, get them into treatment and court supervision as an alternative to incarceration.

VTC offers two alternatives to jail time: a diversion track through the Johnson County District Attorney‚Äôs office and a probation track offered through Johnson County District Court Services. These programs allow eligible Veterans to voluntarily participate in a 12-18 month program of frequent court appearances, drug and alcohol testing two times per week minimum, treatment, recovery support meetings, and a mentor program with another Veteran.

‚ÄúThis is an opportunity to help Veterans who may be suffering from traumatic brain injuries, depression, substance abuse, or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of serving our country,‚Äù said Timothy P. McCarthy, District Court Judge, who spearheaded the effort to bring VTC to Johnson County.

As part of the Johnson County jail booking process, everyone arrested in Johnson County is now asked if they have served in the military. Veterans who are eligible and willing can apply to VTC. To be eligible, Veterans must be Johnson County residents and eligible for either VA benefits or Johnson County Mental Health Center services. Veterans charged with lower level felony or misdemeanor offenses such as DUIs, drug-related charges or domestic violence charges will be considered for the program.

Judge McCarthy presides over the Veterans Treatment Court docket every other Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. beginning Jan. 13.&nbsp;The first event included a flag ceremony, as well as remarks from Kansas Chief Justice Lawton Nuss, District Attorney Stephen Howe, representatives from the Veterans Administration and the VTC team.

In addition to Judge McCarthy, the VTC team is made up of an additional judge, two prosecutors, two public defenders, a VA representative, a probation officer, two program coordinators, six volunteer Veteran mentors and a research student. Out of the 15 team members, five are Veterans and almost all of the rest are the son or daughter of a Veteran. The program utilizes people who already work in Johnson County‚Äôs criminal justice system. The team meets every two weeks for one hour of discussing current cases and one hour of court hearings. The Johnson County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, Johnson County Mental Health Center and the county‚Äôs Justice Information Management System are also part of the VTC team.&nbsp;

Background

In 2008, Judge Robert Russell started a docket just for Veterans in Buffalo, NY after he noticed an increase in the number of Veterans appearing on his&nbsp;Drug Court and Mental Health Court&nbsp;dockets. Today, there are 250 VTC programs in 40 states including Missouri. In the metro area, there are VTC programs in Jackson County, Clay County and KCMO. More information is available here.http://www.justiceforvets.org/what-is-a-veterans-treatment-court&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

About Johnson County, Kansas

Located in the southwestern quadrant of the Kansas City Metropolitan Region, Johnson County, Kansas has a current population of more than 575,000, making it the most populated of the 105 counties in Kansas. For more information visit the county‚Äôs website at&nbsp;www.jocogov.org.

Legal Connection: Military Matters is a program of the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar&nbsp;Foundation.&nbsp;

‚ÄúWe collaborate with support agencies serving Veterans and active duty military in the area to&nbsp;identify the most needed legal services and provide assistance to those who do not qualify for&nbsp;aid from other agencies,‚Äù said Jay Simpson, a Kansas City lawyer who chairs the program‚Äôs&nbsp;Operating Committee.

Those seeking help should first call one of the program‚Äôs community partners, who will do the&nbsp;initial eligibility review and forward referrals to Legal Connection: Military Matters. &nbsp;The new program‚Äôs initial partners include United Way of Greater Kansas City, the Kansas City VA&nbsp;Medical Center, Legal Aid of Western Missouri and Kansas Legal Services, (800-723-6953).

‚ÄúThis program is essential,‚Äù said Alinda Dennis, senior vice president at United Way. ‚ÄúWe have&nbsp;found through the work of United Way‚Äôs Veterans Navigator that many Veterans face obstacles&nbsp;that require the help of a lawyer. In fact, legal assistance ranks third in unmet needs of Veterans&nbsp;nationwide. Unfortunately, the cost prohibits them from seeking legal help. This program helps&nbsp;resolve that critical issue.‚Äù

The goals of Military Matters include:


	Building a pro bono referral network for those who do not qualify for aid from other&nbsp;agencies;
	Collaborating with community partners which direct Veterans to available resources in&nbsp;the community;
	Advocating to support and increase the number of Veterans Courts; and
	Training lawyers to assist Veterans in filing VA benefit claims and appeals.


Attorneys who accept referrals from the program&nbsp;provide free and reduced cost legal services&nbsp;for Veterans and active duty military facing legal issues in areas such as


	navigating the Veterans&nbsp;Administration;
	handling federal criminal charges,
	eviction/foreclosure prevention;
	child support&nbsp;issues;
	domestic violence issues;
	driver‚Äôs license reinstatement and
	warrant relief.&nbsp;

From the School of Law, Washburn University website.

Robert ""Joe"" Pilgrim, Washburn Law, '16, has been named a ""National Law Student of the Year"" by&nbsp;The&nbsp;National Jurist&nbsp;magazine in its Spring 2016 issue. Last November,&nbsp;The&nbsp;National Jurist&nbsp;asked more than 200 U.S. law schools for ""stories of their most devoted students with unparalleled attitudes."" They received more than 100 nominations.

""Pilgrim is one of five inspiring law students from across the nation featured in the Spring issue of&nbsp;The National Jurist&nbsp;magazine,"" according to the article. Pilgrim, a Navy veteran, was described by faculty as ‚Äúone in a million."" His exceptional understanding of veterans' needs made him instrumental in organizing the Veterans Legal Assistance Clinic. He ramped up student involvement and provided insight into how to approach those who have served in the military.

‚ÄúOne thing that continues to push me when I feel tired, frustrated, or I wonder if I‚Äôm really making a difference is this: I‚Äôm glad the veteran I‚Äôm providing legal services to did not give up when he or she may have felt the same way while defending our country,‚Äù Pilgrim is quoted in the article.

After receiving news of the recognition, Pilgrim said, ""I would like to humbly thank everyone who nominated me for&nbsp;The&nbsp;National Jurist&nbsp;recognition, the faculty and staff at Washburn University School of Law for their support, and the Washburn Law Clinic for their undying encouragement and guidance.&nbsp;Washburn's approach to guided instruction focuses not only on the practice of law but also on the personal development of the students.""

Joe worked at KLS as a special AmeriCorps Law Corpsman in 2014 - 2015, helping veterans with their legal needs. Read his article &nbsp;""Lawyers Serving Veterans: Why I Do It,"" from the July-August 2015 Journal of the Kansas Bar Association.

DO YOU NEED A WILL?

Elder Law Advice line at 1-888-353-5338 (35 Elder)

&nbsp;

Many people believe that a will is the best way to express their desires for disposing of their property after their death.&nbsp; This may or may not be true.&nbsp; There are other things to consider.&nbsp;

This document discusses the pros and cons of a will, as well as describing the alternatives available to Kansans.

&nbsp;

Advantages of a Will ‚Äì

Kansas law defines how a person‚Äôs estate is distributed at death ‚Äì ¬Ω to a spouse (if married over 10 years) and ¬Ω to any children of the deceased.&nbsp; A will is one way to alter this distribution.&nbsp;

One should consider a will if:


	There are children they don‚Äôt want to receive any of their estate
	There are children they wish to receive more than their ‚Äúshare‚Äù of the estate.
	The home or other property is not in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship and they want their spouse to inherit the full value of the estate.


Any property with a title ‚Äì home, land, car, motorcycle, RV, etc. ‚Äì have special rules that apply, if the owner is dead at the time of the sale.

In families where personal property cannot be distributed without conflict, may find that a will, and oversight by a Judge, limits the conflict.

&nbsp;

Disadvantages of a Will ‚Äì

If there are assets to be distributed under the will, the family must file the will for probate with the Court.&nbsp; This involves hiring an attorney to provide the proper paperwork and instruction in the process.&nbsp; The Executor appointed in the will (usually a family member) must take action to keep the assets safe.&nbsp; However, nothing will be completed or distributed until at least four months after the filing of the will with the court.&nbsp; This period of time is reserved for creditors of the deceased to file claims against the estate. &nbsp;&nbsp;

If there are no assets to be distributed under the will, it is still the responsibility of the Executor named in the will (or the holder of the will) to notify all heirs and provide them with a copy of the will.&nbsp; The Executor would want to consult with an attorney to make sure this process happened appropriately.

&nbsp;

Alternatives to a Will ‚Äì

Before you decide that a will is something everyone must have, consider the following alternatives which may cover all the items you would include in a will:

Home or other real estate:&nbsp; Transfer on Death Deed ‚Äì this is a document that can be prepared and signed at any time.&nbsp; It directs the transfer of your interest in property to another person at the moment of your death.&nbsp; It doesn‚Äôt avoid creditors or SRS Estate Recovery.&nbsp; It doesn‚Äôt avoid taxes (although only very large estates are taxed in Kansas now).&nbsp; It doesn‚Äôt transfer ownership until your death, so you don‚Äôt cause possible Medicaid Transfer of Asset penalties.&nbsp; You still own your property, so you can sell it at any time.&nbsp; Property owned in joint tenancy with right of survivorship is fully transferred to the surviving owner, upon the death of one owner.

Note:&nbsp; You must provide an accurate legal description of the property, so obtaining a copy of your deed is best.&nbsp;

CD‚Äôs, Stock Accounts or Life Insurance: Designation of a Beneficiary ‚Äì this is an action that is a regular part of setting up or rolling over these assets.&nbsp; You can name a person or more than one person as your beneficiary and these assets are paid to them, upon proof of your death.&nbsp; Stocks held outside of a brokerage account may not qualify for this option.

Car, Recreational or Other vehicle:&nbsp; Transfer on Death form ‚Äì this is a designation you can have added to your car title.&nbsp; It is best to do with when pay your annual vehicle registration.&nbsp; Work with the County Treasurer or Tag office to complete the paperwork.&nbsp; The vehicle will be transferred to them upon the proof of death of all owners. This must be separately done for each automobile owned.

Bank Accounts: Pay on Death Beneficiaries ‚Äì this can be made in writing at the bank to designate to whom the money should be paid upon the death of all account owners.&nbsp; The paperwork can be provided by the Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be done separately for each account held in each bank.&nbsp;

Personal property ‚Äì Your written instructions or written designation of ownership ‚Äì If you wish to leave instructions about the personal property you own (furniture, jewelry, family heirlooms, etc.) you can write down your instructions for your family to follow.&nbsp; You should provide copies to one or all family members or leave your instructions in a designated location.&nbsp; If you want something more binding, you can write and sign a self created document that you and other named persons own certain personal property in joint tenancy, with rights of survivorship.&nbsp; You should sign and notarize the statement.&nbsp; This will give the other person a legal basis to prove their claim of ownership.

‚ñ∫&nbsp;If you find that this list contains all the items you are concerned about distributing, you don‚Äôt need to go to the trouble and expense of preparing and probating a will (or preparing a living trust).&nbsp; Kansas law provides sound legal alternatives to probate that satisfy the needs of many people.

probate
Kansas Probate
inheritance
executor
estate
administrator",Wills / Estates,"What is probate?

Probate is the process of proving a will. It occurs after someone dies. All estate administration proceedings are involved in this process.


	
	It‚Äôs the practice of deciding what to do with someone‚Äôs stuff after they die.
	


A person‚Äôs ‚Äúestate‚Äù is their property at the time of death.


	
	Some property passes directly to others. These include properties held in joint tenancy, life insurance proceeds and retirement plans payable to a named beneficiary.
	
	
	Everything else may be subject to probate.
	


Estates are usually ‚Äúprobated‚Äù in the county where the deceased owned property.


	
	If property is owned in several states, further actions are sometimes needed in those states.
	


Why probate?


	
	&nbsp;To decide if the deceased left a legal will
	
	
	&nbsp;To assign an executor or administrator (surviving&nbsp;spouse, adult child, bank or trust company) to manage the deceased‚Äôs estate
	
	
	&nbsp;To collect and define all property of the estate
	
	
	&nbsp;To protect the&nbsp;property of the estate
	
	
	&nbsp;To give a way to change assets into cash so it can be distributed to the people who benefit from the will (beneficiaries) or paid to creditors
	
	
	&nbsp;To pay existing taxes and debts in a prompt manner
	
	
	&nbsp;To figure out who has a right to share in the estate and to divide the property to the correct parties
	
	
	To transfer legal ownership of real estate and other property
	
	
	To extend the court‚Äôs protection to the person who settles a deceased‚Äôs affairs and distributes the property
	


NOTE: There may be special circumstances where all persons interested in an estate, by agreement of all parties and after review with their lawyers, conclude that formal&nbsp;probate&nbsp;actions are unnecessary.&nbsp;


	
	However, anyone who deals with the deceased‚Äôs property without qualifying as an executor or administrator can be held personally responsible for his or her conduct and should be fully advised by&nbsp;counsel&nbsp;before acting.
	


What is involved?

Naming an Executor: The will usually names an executor to manage the estate assets.&nbsp; If there is no will, the court will appoint an administrator.

Duties of the Executor: The executor or administrator, normally under the guidance and direction of a lawyer, is personally responsible for the proper handling and settlement of the deceased‚Äôs estate.

The executor or administrator will usually be required to:


	
	Notify heirs and creditors of the&nbsp;probate&nbsp;proceedings.
	
	
	Take possession of inventory and preserve the&nbsp;probate&nbsp;assets of the deceased.
	
	
	Collect all income, such as rents, interest and dividends, demand and collect all&nbsp;debts, claims and notes due.
	
	
	Manage the deceased‚Äôs business.
	
	
	Determine the names, ages, residences and degrees of relationship of all heirs and closest relatives of the deceased.
	
	
	Complete any pending lawsuits in which the estate of the deceased has an interest.
	
	
	Determine, prepare returns for, and pay all state and federal&nbsp;inheritance, estate and income taxes.
	
	
	Pay the valid claims of creditors of the deceased and, when needed, sell property to raise funds to pay claims, taxes, and expenses of administration.
	
	
	Transfer a deceased‚Äôs title to real and other titled property to his or her heirs.
	
	
	Distribute all remaining assets to the proper persons.
	


The process: Probate&nbsp;procedures in Kansas are not hard, but they need some&nbsp;practice. To achieve the desired results they must be handled with a grasp of the basic legal principles.&nbsp;

These proceedings may require: preparing and filing several legal documents; giving or publishing notices, holding court hearings; getting appraisals of property, preparing income, gift and estate tax returns; providing an accounting of funds; distributing property and securing the final release of the executor or administrator by the court.

What is the role of the court?

All probate proceedings are subject to the&nbsp;authority&nbsp;of the District Court.&nbsp;


	
	With the exception of certain actions such as estates administered under the Simplified Estates Act and Informal Administration Act, the acts of the executor or administrator are subject to the scrutiny and approval of the court.&nbsp;
	


Final determinations are made by the Court, including payment of debts which exceed $1500, allowance of lawyer, executor or administrator fees, and orders of final distribution of the assets.&nbsp;

Juries are not used in probate matters.

How long does&nbsp;probate&nbsp;take?

The first step to probate is to file a petition.


	
	Filing must happen within 6 months after the date of death. Persons having knowledge and access to a will may offer it for probate at any time within the 6 months following the death.
	
	
	The filing of state and federal death tax returns may be required and tax payments are due no later than 9 months after the date of death.
	
	
	After filing/beginning of probate:

	
		
		Appointing an executor or administrator usually takes 4 to 5 weeks from the date the petition is filed.
		
		
		Creditors have 4 months after actual notice to file claims against the estate.
		
		
		Since the problems of each estate differ, no exact time schedule can be given for the length required to probate the estate.&nbsp;
		
	
	
	
	However, no estate with assets amounting to more than the legal allowance and debts, taxes and costs may be closed before 6 months after the date of death.
	


What property is included in the&nbsp;probate&nbsp;process?

Not all property owned by the deceased is subject to probate.

For example:


	
	Life insurance will pass directly to the chosen beneficiary and does not require probate unless the beneficiary is the insured‚Äôs estate or executor.&nbsp;
	
	
	Titles to joint&nbsp;tenancy&nbsp;property with right of survivorship pass automatically to the surviving joint&nbsp;tenant(s), subject to possible tax&nbsp;liability.
	
	
	A bank account with a ‚Äúpay on death‚Äù provision will pass directly to the named party.&nbsp;
	
	
	Transfer on Death provisions are available with respect to securities, titled vehicles and real estate.
	


Property not subject to probate will not pass under the deceased‚Äôs will. This may weaken or destroy the deceased‚Äôs wishes about distribution of his or her property.

What taxes are involved?



The taxable estate is different than the probate estate.

It includes both probate and non-probate assets.

Every estate may be subject to several types of death taxes, depending on the total value of all assets included in the taxable estate and to whom the assets pass.

A.&nbsp;Federal estate tax: It is based on the value of the assets in the taxable estate. The federal estate tax is a graduated tax which is imposed on the net estate after allowing for certain deductions and exemptions. The exemptions are large, so many estates will owe no tax. You should consult a lawyer.

B.&nbsp;Kansas&nbsp;Inheritance&nbsp;Tax: This tax is based on the value of the assets received from the deceased and the heirs‚Äô degree of relationship to the deceased.


	
	However, the Kansas Inheritance Tax may be payable even though no federal estate tax is due.
	


Kansas real estate cannot be transferred with clear title after the death of an owner or co-owner without obtaining a Kansas&nbsp;Inheritance&nbsp;tax Waiver.


	
	The Waiver is filed with the Register of Deeds in the county in which the property is located.
	
	
	The only exception from this requirement is when the deceased died more than 10 years before the transfer.
	


C.&nbsp;Federal and state fiduciary income tax: This tax is based on income and expenses created from the probate estate assets. This tax is like the federal and state personal income tax.

NOTE: The obligation to prepare and file tax returns and pay the appropriate tax&nbsp;liability&nbsp;may exist even if the deceased left no probate estate.


	
	This is because jointly held property, life insurance and certain types of transfers by the deceased before death are subject to taxation by the state and federal governments.
	


‚Äã

Due to the complexities involved, an executor or administrator should not try to draft the necessary returns, compute the taxes due nor meet the necessary filing requirements without the supervision and guidance of a lawyer.

&nbsp;

What are the fees and costs?

The fee of the administrator and lawyer are not fixed by any law or&nbsp;court rule.


	
	They must mirror the fair value of the services actually performed in relation to the size of the estate.&nbsp;
	
	
	The fees of the executor or administrator and lawyer are subject to the approval of the probate court.
	


The estate administration costs include court costs, which are set by law, publication costs, and bond premiums if a bond is required by the court.

What about small estates?

The laws of Kansas say that when the deceased leaves a&nbsp;spouse&nbsp;or minor children, a simplified proceeding may be used when:


	
	The estate is made up entirely of&nbsp;personal property
	
	
	The estate does not exceed the amount of&nbsp;exempt property
	
	
	The estate does not exceed the maximum family allowance of $25,000&nbsp;
	
	
	It‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúRefusal to Grant Letters of Administration.""

	
		
		This proceeding can also be used by a&nbsp;creditor&nbsp;where the deceased‚Äôs estate consists of real and&nbsp;personal property&nbsp;which does not exceed $25,000, and where there is no claim for family allowance by surviving&nbsp;spouse&nbsp;or minor children.
		
		
		The availability of the ‚ÄúRefusal to Grant Letters of Administration‚Äù process can be determined by the lawyer and the executor or administrator at the time of the initial conference.
		
		
		Probate can be avoided if the estate has no real property and the value of the estate is less than the total value of all demands against the estate.&nbsp;
		
	
	
	
	Any person possessing a will may then file it with an&nbsp;affidavit. If assets are discovered later, the will can then be probated and the assets distributed according to the will.&nbsp;
	


IF the deceased had no will and left only real estate to the surviving&nbsp;spouse&nbsp;and other family members, a ‚ÄúDetermination of Descent‚Äù proceeding may be started at any time 6 months after death.


	
	This proceeding takes about 30 days to complete and is often used when reasons to probate administration do not exist.
	


NOTE: Even if a ‚ÄúRefusal to Grant Letters of Administration‚Äù or a ‚ÄúDetermination of Descent‚Äù proceeding is used, there may be Kansas&nbsp;Inheritance&nbsp;Tax and federal estate tax filing requirements.

What should be done?

Property: If someone close to you has died, nothing should be done to disturb&nbsp;any of the property of the deceased unless it is necessary to protect it from being lost or destroyed.

Who to call? Shortly after the death, a lawyer should be contacted to discuss the matter with those close to the deceased.&nbsp;


	
	In general, the surviving husband or wife should make the initial contact if he or she lived with the deceased.
	
	
	In other situations, it is recommended that the closest relatives contact the lawyer.
	


The lawyer will give advice, figure out if probate proceedings will be needed, and explain the procedures involved.


	
	If you have a will of a deceased person, you should give it to the lawyer at the first consultation.
	


Attending to the details of a probate proceeding may be a complex, time-consuming task, and it may be necessary for relatives or close friends to face this task in a time of grief and trauma.&nbsp;


	
	A lawyer has the technical ability to smoothly handle the necessary legal procedures and relieve those grieving of this burden.

This is a form to create an affidavit available through the Kansas Judicial Council. &nbsp;This form allows the heirs to transfer up to $40,000 in assets (usually bank accounts) to all the heirs, without any thing going through probate court. &nbsp;The affidavit is prepared and presented to the holder of the assets.

This form can be used to transfer title to automobiles by all the heirs, following the death of the primary owner. &nbsp;It is also for estates with less than $40,000 in value.
Because of the title issues involved, land and homes cannot be transferred in this manner, even if they are of very low value.

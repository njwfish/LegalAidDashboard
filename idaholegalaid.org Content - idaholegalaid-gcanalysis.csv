Bankruptcy Overview

Bankruptcy is a legal procedure for dealing with debt problems of individuals and businesses. The primary purposes of bankruptcy are:


	to give the person filing for bankruptcy a ""fresh start"" by relieving the debtor of most debts by giving him or her a “discharge,” and
	to repay creditors (the persons who the debtor owes money) in an orderly manner to the extent that the debtor has property available for payment.


[TOP]

Types of Bankruptcy for Individuals

There are five basic types of bankruptcy cases provided for under the Bankruptcy Code, but only two are relevant for ordinary individuals. Chapter 7 bankruptcy requires the sale of a person’s property with the proceeds to be used to pay that person’s debts. This is called “liquidation.” Chapter 13 bankruptcy provides for the adjustment of debts. In this type of bankruptcy, a debtor is allowed to keep property and pay debts over a period of time, usually three to five years.

The information on this site is limited to individual bankruptcy only. If you are seeking information about filing a bankruptcy for a business, you MUST contact an attorney.

[TOP]

Credit Counseling

Bankruptcy begins with the debtor filing a petition with the bankruptcy court. However, prior to filing this petition, the debtor must obtain credit counseling from an approved provider. The credit counseling must occur within 180 days prior to filing a petition. Once credit counseling has been obtained, the debtor must file a statement of compliance and a certificate of credit counseling furnished by the provider. Failure to obtain credit counseling may result in dismissal of the case. To assist bankruptcy filers, the U.S. Trustee Program has created a list of approved credit counseling providers, located at http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/cc_approved.htm.

[TOP]

Collect Your Financial Information

The debtor’s first step is to collect his or her financial information, including bank statements, tax returns, pay stubs, creditor statements, and a list of the debtor’s assets (real property, investments, personal possessions, etc.).

[TOP]

Decide What Type of Bankruptcy You Will File

Once information has been gathered, the debtor must decide what type of bankruptcy to file. Individuals generally will file either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. These types of bankruptcies are discussed in more detail later. To determine whether to file under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor must complete the “means test.” The means test looks at the debtor’s income and expenses to determine if a person’s income is low enough to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If the debtor’s income is lower than a certain threshold, the debtor qualifies to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If the debtor’s income is higher than a certain threshold, the debtor may not file under Chapter 7, but can still file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The “means test” is discussed in more detail under the section “Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.”

[TOP]

Prepare a Petition

After the debtor decides what type of bankruptcy to file, he or she may begin filling out the petition. To prepare a bankruptcy petition the debtor must have accurate and up-to-date information on finances. The bankruptcy court will want to see information on a person’s income, debts and assets. In addition to the petition, a debtor will also need to file forms known as “schedules” that discuss the debtor’s assets, liabilities, and creditors in more detail. The petition, schedules, and other forms can be found at http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx.

[TOP]

Bankruptcy &nbsp;Stay

Once the petition is filed, an injunction, called a “stay,” immediately goes into effect stopping the debtor’s creditors from taking any further action relating to the collection of debts. This means that the creditor will not be able to garnish wages, bring a lawsuit, or make a telephone call demanding payment without first getting approval from the bankruptcy court.

[TOP]

Section 341 Meeting

Following the filing of the petition, the debtor is required to attend a meeting with a court-appointed trustee. The purpose of this meeting, a 341 meeting, is to ensure that the debtor accurately represented assets and liabilities in the petition. The trustee will put the debtor under oath and ask questions about the debtor’s income and property. Creditors are also allowed to attend and may ask the debtor questions.

[TOP]

Financial Management Course

Following the 341 meeting, the debtor is required to attend a court-approved course in financial management. The court may refuse to discharge debts if the debtor fails to complete this course. This requirement is found in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code at 11 U.S.C. § 727 for Chapter 7 and 11 U.S.C. § 1328 for Chapter 13. A list of approved financial management courses can be found at http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/de_approved.htm. If the court determines that no financial course exists near the debtor, the court may waive this requirement. However, if the court does not waive this requirement and the debtor fails to complete the course, the court may refuse to discharge the debtor’s debts.

[TOP]

Next Step – Chapter 7

The next step in the bankruptcy process often depends on the type of bankruptcy the debtor filed. In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, the debtor must surrender any non-exempt assets to a trustee appointed by the court. Exempt property, which does not need to be surrendered, is discussed under “Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.” Once the trustee has received all of the non-exempt property from the debtor, the trustee will then sell all the non-exempt property for cash and distribute the cash to the debtor’s creditors. This process is called “liquidation.” Any debts not satisfied through the liquidation process are usually discharged within a few months, meaning the debtor is no longer responsible for paying those debts.

[TOP]

Next Step – Chapter 13

In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding, the debtor normally keeps all nonexempt assets and creates a plan to repay debts within a three-to-five year time period. The nonexempt assets can be retained so long as the total of the payments made under the plan exceed the value of the nonexempt assets.&nbsp; The repayment plan must be approved by the court. Once approved, the debtor makes payments to a court appointed trustee, who distributes the payments to the creditors. Once the payment plan is completed, the debtor may receive a discharge of other outstanding debts.

[TOP]

Adversary Proceedings

In both Chapters 7 and 13 bankruptcy cases litigation may be started to determine the true owners of property, the value of property, how much debt is owed, and whether the debtor should be discharged from certain debts. These cases are called “adversary proceedings.” Litigation in bankruptcy court is similar to litigation in civil cases; there may be discovery, pretrial proceedings, settlement efforts, and a trial.

[TOP]

Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, the debtor must surrender any non-exempt assets to a trustee appointed by the court. The trustee will then sell all the non-exempt property for cash and distribute the cash to the debtor’s creditors. This process is called “liquidation.” Any debts not satisfied through the liquidation process are usually discharged within a few months, meaning the debtor is no longer responsible for paying those debts.

[TOP]

Filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

Who can file for Bankruptcy?

Any individual can file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. However, Chapter 7 bankruptcy was created for individuals who truly cannot pay their debts. Therefore, to receive relief under Chapter 7, an individual must qualify under the “means test.” The means test is a method to determine if an individual’s income is too high for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. An individual can qualify under the means test if his or her current monthly income is less than the median monthly income for a household of his or her size in Idaho. If an individual’s current monthly income is higher than the median monthly income, that individual may still qualify under the means test if his or her disposable income is less than a certain amount. Disposable income is the amount of money a person has remaining after he or she pays all allowed monthly expenses—such as housing, utilities, and food. The means test calculator may assist an individual in determining if he or she qualifies under the means test for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

An individual must complete Form 22A in order to determine if he or she qualifies for Chapter 7 bankruptcy under the means test. If an individual does not qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy under the means tests, the court will either dismiss the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition or permit the debtor to change the petition to Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is available for those who do not qualify under Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

Filing a bankruptcy case without using an attorney, known as filing “pro se,” is extremely difficult. It is very important that a bankruptcy case be filed and handled correctly. Bankruptcy has long-term financial and legal consequences. Hiring an attorney is strongly recommended.

Corporations and partnership must have an attorney to file a bankruptcy case.

How do I file for bankruptcy?

First, individual debtors are generally required to obtain&nbsp;credit counseling from an approved provider&nbsp;within 180 days before filing a case, and to file a statement of compliance and a certificate of credit counseling furnished by the provider. Failure to do so may result in dismissal of the case. To assist bankruptcy filers, the U.S. Trustee Program has created a list of approved credit counseling providers, located at http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/cc_approved.htm.

After completing credit counseling, a bankruptcy case begins with a debtor obtaining and filling out the Official Bankruptcy Forms. The official bankruptcy forms contain a petition and several forms known as “schedules.” The petition informs the court of the debtors desire to file for bankruptcy. The schedules contain information about the debtor’s assets, liabilities, income, expenditures, and other necessary financial information. The debtor must fill out these forms and file them with the court. The forms should be filed with the bankruptcy court serving the area where the individual resides or where the business debtor has its principal place of business.

In order to complete the Official Bankruptcy Forms, a debtor will need the following information:


	A list of all creditors and the amount and nature of their claims;
	The source, amount, and frequency of the debtor’s income;
	A list of all of the debtor’s property; and
	A detailed list of the debtor’s monthly living expenses, i.e., food, clothing, shelter, utilities, taxes, transportation, medicine, etc.


In addition to completing the Official Bankruptcy Forms, the debtor will also need to pay a filing fee. The amount of the filing fee can be found at http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/fees/bankruptcy-court-miscellaneous-fee-schedule. The fee should be paid to the clerk of the court upon filing or may, with the court’s permission, be paid by individual debtors in installments.

Once the petition is filed, a trustee is appointed to administer the case. The trustee receives all of the debtor’s non-exempt property from the debtor. The trustee then sells the non-exempt property and distributes the funds to the debtor’s creditors.

Generally, the debtor will receive a discharge from most debts within three months after the Chapter 7 petition has been filed.

[TOP]

Exempt Property

Certain categories of property are exempt from creditors when a debtor files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Exempt property does not need to be surrendered to the trustee, but instead the debtor is able to keep possession of exempt property. In order to claim these exemptions, the debtor must list all his or her protected assets on Bankruptcy Schedule C. Failure to list exempt properties on this schedule could result in the properties being liquidated. The following categories are exempt:

The Discharge Process in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

What is a bankruptcy discharge?

A bankruptcy discharge essentially releases the debtor from personal liability of all debts included in the bankruptcy. The discharge is a permanent court order establishing that the debtor is no longer legally obligated to pay debts that have been released in bankruptcy. Once a discharge is complete, the court clerk sends copies of the order to the debtor and all creditors. The order states that no collection attempts, legal actions or communications, such as phone calls and letters, can be made to the debtor regarding the debts.

Are all of my debts discharged?

Not all debts are discharged. The Bankruptcy Code identifies 19 categories of debt that are nondischargeable. These categories can be found in section 523(a), and include debts such as debts received by false pretenses, debts for spousal support and child support, certain types of tax claims, and others. Most of these debts do not require a judicial order declaring them to be nondischargeable.&nbsp; Some examples of these are most taxes, divorce related debts and restitution.&nbsp; Three of the categories, however, do require a judge to determine whether or not they are dischargeable in an adversary proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Debts listed in section 523(a) will survive a discharge meaning the debtor will still be obligated to pay those obligations after the bankruptcy proceeding..

When can I get my debts discharged?

In a Chapter 7 case, a debtor receives a discharge once the time has expired for a creditor to file a complaint objecting to the discharge. A creditor must file a complaint within 60 days following the first date set for the 341 meeting. This is usually about three months after the bankruptcy petition is filed.

Do I automatically get my debts discharged?

The debtor usually receives a discharge automatically. However, there are certain instances when a discharge is not automatic. The first instance is when the debtor fails to complete an instructional course concerning financial management. The failure to compete a financial management course could lead the court to deny a debtor a discharge. If there are no adequate education programs available, the court may waive this requirement. To assist bankruptcy filers, the U.S. Trustee Program has created a list of approved financial management courses, located at http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/de_approved.htm.

A discharge can also be denied if a creditor objects to a discharge by filing a complaint in bankruptcy court before the deadline. This begins a lawsuit known as an “adversary proceeding.” This lawsuit proceeds much like a civil lawsuit, with discovery, pretrial motions, and a trial. The objecting party has the burden of proving all the facts of the objection.

Other reasons why a debtor may not qualify for an automatic discharge are described in section 727(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. This includes defrauding creditors, destroying records, violating earlier court orders, and others. 

How do I get my debts discharged?

The bankruptcy court will mail a copy of the order of discharge to the creditors, trustee, debtor, and the debtor’s attorney. This order informs the creditors that the debts owed to them have been discharged and that they should not seek to further collect those debts. The order also warns the creditors that any failure to comply with the order could lead to punishment for contempt.

Are my spouse’s debts discharged when I file for bankruptcy?

In a community property state, such as Idaho, debts incurred by either spouse during the marriage are generally considered community debts. If only one spouse files for bankruptcy in Idaho, the eligible community debts of both spouses may be discharged.

[TOP]

Filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy with a Spouse

Idaho follows “community property” rules. This means that generally property acquired by one spouse during the marriage is owned by both spouses. Similarly, most debts incurred by one spouse during the marriage are owed by both spouses. Therefore, if only one spouse files for bankruptcy in Idaho, all of the eligible community debts of both spouses could be discharged but all of the community property must be addressed in the bankruptcy proceeding.

Do I Owe My Spouse’s Debt?

In Idaho, generally debts acquired by one spouse in a marriage are owed by the “community” (the couple), even if only one spouse signed the paperwork for the debt.

After a legal separation or divorce, a debt is generally owed only by the spouse who incurred the debt, unless the debt was incurred for family necessities, to maintain jointly owned assets (e.g. to make repairs to a home still owned by both spouses), or if the spouses keep a joint account.

Can a creditor take my spouse’s property?

Once a bankruptcy is filed an automatic stay is entered which prevents a debtor from trying to collect the debt.

In Idaho, before the bankruptcy is filed creditors of one spouse can go after the assets and income of the married couple to recover joint debts, regardless of whose name is on the title document to the asset. For example, a business owner's name may not be on the title to her spouse's boat, but in most community property states, that would not stop a creditor from suing in court to take the boat to pay off the business owner's debts, assuming the boat was purchased with community funds.

Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding, the debtor keeps all assets and creates a plan to repay debts within a three-to-five year time period. The repayment plan must be approved by the court. Once approved, the debtor makes payments to a court-appointed trustee, who distributes the payments to the creditors. Once the payment plan is completed, the debtor may receive a discharge of other outstanding debts.

Filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

Who can file for Bankruptcy?

Any individual can file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Filing a bankruptcy case without using an attorney, known as filing “pro se,” is extremely difficult. It is very important that a bankruptcy case be filed and handled correctly. Bankruptcy has long-term financial and legal consequences. Hiring an attorney is strongly recommended.

Corporations and partnership must have an attorney to file a bankruptcy case.

How do I file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy?

First, individual debtors are generally required to obtain&nbsp;credit counseling from an approved provider&nbsp;within 180 days before filing a case, and to file a statement of compliance and a certificate of credit counseling furnished by the provider. Failure to do so may result in dismissal of the case. To assist bankruptcy filers, the U.S. Trustee Program has created a list of approved credit counseling providers, located at http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/cc_approved.htm.

After completing credit counseling, a bankruptcy case begins with a debtor obtaining and filling out the Official Bankruptcy Forms. The official bankruptcy forms contain a petition and several forms known as “schedules.” The petition informs the court of the debtor’s desire to file for bankruptcy. The schedules contain information about the debtor’s assets, liabilities, income, expenditures, and other necessary financial information. The debtor must fill out these forms and file them with the court. The forms should be filed with the bankruptcy court serving the area where the individual resides or where the business debtor has its principal place of business. In addition to completing the Official Bankruptcy Forms, the debtor will also need to pay a filing fee. The amount of the filing fee can be found at http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/fees/bankruptcy-court-miscellaneous-fee-schedule. The fee should be paid to the clerk of the court upon filing or may, with the court’s permission, be paid by individual debtors in installments.

In order to complete the Official Bankruptcy Forms, a debtor will need the following information:


	A list of all creditors and the amount and nature of their claims;
	The source, amount, and frequency of the debtor’s income;
	A list of all of the debtor’s property; and
	A detailed list of the debtor’s monthly living expenses, i.e., food, clothing, shelter, utilities, taxes, transportation, medicine, etc.


In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor will also need to file a repayment plan with the court. Often, the repayment plan is created with the help of a credit counselor during credit counseling. The court must approve of the repayment plan in order to proceed with Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Generally, the court will conduct a confirmation hearing to determine whether the repayment plan is feasible and in accordance with the bankruptcy code. Once the repayment plan is confirmed, the debtor will need to start making payments according to the plan.

After the petition is filed,&nbsp; a trustee is appointed who will administer the case. The trustee collects payments from the debtor, according to the repayment plan, and distributes the payments to the creditors.

Once the repayment plan has been completed, the court may then grant a discharge of the debtor’s debts.

The Discharge Process in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

What is a bankruptcy discharge?

A bankruptcy discharge essentially releases the debtor from personal liability of all debts included in the bankruptcy. The discharge is a permanent court order establishing that the debtor is no longer legally obligated to pay debts that have been released in bankruptcy. Once a discharge is complete, the court clerk sends copies of the order to the debtor and all creditors. The order states that no collection attempts, legal actions or communications, such as phone calls and letters, can be made to the debtor regarding the debts.

Generally, discharges in Chapter 13 bankruptcy are only allowed for debts that the debtor has competed payments under the repayment plan. However, in limited situation a debtor may receive a hardship discharge, which discharges a debt even if the debtor has not satisfied the payments under the repayment plan. A hardship discharge may occur if circumstances arise that prevents the debtor from complying with the repayment plan. A hardship discharge is only available if three requirements are met: 1) the debtors failure to complete the repayment plan is out of the debtors control and is not the fault of the debtor; 2) the creditors have received at least as much as they would have in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case; and 3) modification of the repayment plan is not possible.

Are all of my debts discharged?

Generally, all debts provided for in the repayment plan are discharged upon completion of the plan. However, some debts are not dischargeable in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. These debts are long-term obligations such as a home mortgage, debts for child support, debts for certain taxes, debts for most government funded or guaranteed educational loans or benefit overpayments, debts relating to the death or physical injury of another while driving intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and debts for restitution or a criminal fine included in a sentence on the debtors conviction of a crime.&nbsp;

When can I get my debts discharged?

In a Chapter 13 case, a discharge is generally granted once the debtor has completed all payments under the repayment plan. Repayment plans usually occur over a three-to-five year time period. Therefore, a discharge in a Chapter 13 case typically occurs after three-to-five years.

Do I automatically get my debts discharged?

The debtor usually receives a discharge once the debtor has completed all payments under the repayment plan. However, there are certain instances when a discharge will not be granted. The first instance is when the debtor fails to complete an instructional course concerning financial management. The failure to compete a financial management course could lead the court to deny a debtor a discharge. If there are no adequate education programs available, the court may waive this requirement. To assist bankruptcy filers, the U.S. Trustee Program has created a list of approved financial management courses, located at http://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/ccde/de approved.htm.

As long as the debtor completed payments according to the repayment plan, the debtor will receive a discharge. Creditors can object to confirmation of the Debtor’s proposed plan.

Other reasons why a debtor may not qualify for a discharge are described in section 727(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. This includes defrauding creditors, destroying records, violating earlier court orders, and others.

How do I get my debts discharged?

The bankruptcy court will mail a copy of the order of discharge to the creditors, trustee, debtor, and the debtor’s attorney. This order informs the creditors that the debts owed to them have been discharged and that they should not seek to further collect those debts. The order also warns the creditors that any failure to comply with the order could lead to punishment for contempt.

Are my spouse’s debts discharged when I file for bankruptcy?

In a community property state, such as Idaho, debts incurred by either spouse during the marriage are generally considered community debts. If only one spouse files for bankruptcy in Idaho, the eligible community debts of both spouses may be discharged.

[TOP]

Filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy with a Spouse

Idaho follows “community property” rules. This means that generally property acquired by one spouse during the marriage is owned by both spouses. Similarly, most debts incurred by one spouse during the marriage are owed by both spouses. Therefore, if only one spouse files for bankruptcy in Idaho, all of the eligible community debts of both spouses could be discharged.

Do I Owe My Spouse’s Debt?

In Idaho, generally debts acquired by one spouse in a marriage are owed by the “community” (the couple), even if only one spouse signed the paperwork for the debt.

After a legal separation or divorce, a debt is generally owed only by the spouse who incurred the debt, unless the debt was incurred for family necessities, to maintain jointly owned assets (e.g. to make repairs to a home still owned by both parties), or if the spouses keep a joint account.

Can a creditor take my spouse’s property?

Once a bankruptcy is filed an automatic stay is entered which prevents a debtor from trying to collect the debt.

In Idaho, before the bankruptcy is filed creditors of one spouse can go after the assets and income of the married couple to recover joint debts, regardless of whose name is on the title document to the asset. For example, a business owner's name may not be on the title to her spouse's boat, but in most community property states, that would not stop a creditor from suing in court to take the boat to pay off the business owner's debts, assuming the boat was purchased with community funds.

Frequently Asked Questions

Can I file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy a second time?

A debtor may not file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy if the debtor previously received a discharge in a Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 case filed within eight years.

A debtor may not file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy if the debtor previously received a discharge in a Chapter 12 or Chapter 13 filed within six years, unless the debtor either paid all the allowed unsecured claims in the earlier case or the debtor made payments under the earlier repayment plan totaling 70 percent of the allowed unsecured claims and the plan was proposed in good faith.

[TOP]

Can I file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy a second time?

A debtor may not file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy if the debtor received a prior discharge in a Chapter 13 case filed within two years.

[TOP]

How do I find an Attorney?

Debtors are strongly encouraged to obtain the services of competent legal counsel. Contact the Idaho State Bar Lawyer Referral Service (208-334-4500, http://isb.idaho.gov) for the name of an attorney in your area who will provide an initial half hour consultation for no more than $35.&nbsp;

[TOP]

What can I do if a creditor attempts to collect a discharged debt after the case is concluded?

If a creditor attempts collection efforts on a discharged debt, the debtor can file a motion with the court, reporting the action and asking that the case be reopened to address the matter. The bankruptcy court will often do so to ensure that the discharge is not violated. The discharge constitutes a permanent statutory injunction prohibiting creditors from taking any action, including the filing of a lawsuit, designed to collect a discharged debt. A creditor can be sanctioned by the court for violating the discharge injunction. The normal sanction for violating the discharge injunction is civil contempt, which is often punishable by a fine.

Can I Lose My home?

Homeowners who are having trouble or have fallen behind in making their mortgage payments may have options that would allow them to avoid foreclosure and bankruptcy. For more information regarding foreclosure, please visit the U.S. Court’s website at http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyResources/Foreclosure.aspx.

Beware of offers made once your house is in foreclosure—there are a number of fraudulent schemes specifically directed at individuals facing foreclosure. The Idaho Attorney General’s Office has created a manual to help you prevent fraud from occurring. This manual can be viewed at http://www.ag.idaho.gov/publications/consumer/foreclosureWorkbook/foreclosureworkbook.pdf. If you feel suspicious about a proposal, such as one that requires the transfer of your property to a third party in order to avoid foreclosure, please submit a complaint form with the Idaho Attorney General’s Office. The complaint form can be accessed at http://www.ag.idaho.gov/ consumer&nbsp; Protection/forms/ ComplaintFormInformation.html.

Is bankruptcy right for me?

Sometimes it is best to postpone filing for bankruptcy. For instance, if you think you will incur significant debts in the near future, it might make sense to wait to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Although your current debts will be discharged in your bankruptcy, debts incurred after you file for bankruptcy will not be. Because you cannot file for bankruptcy for eight years after the filing date in a previous Chapter 7 discharge, you will be on the hook for those debts for a long time. Other factors, such as your mortgage and income, may also help you understand when to file for bankruptcy.

&nbsp;

It is very important that a bankruptcy case be filed and handled correctly. Bankruptcy has long-term financial and legal consequences. Hiring an attorney is strongly recommended.

Identity Theft",,Consumer,"What is Identity Theft?

Identity Theft is the largest consumer complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) annually.&nbsp; If you have been the victim of identity theft, it could mean someone has used your name to:


	make purchases,
	get credit cards
	rent an apartment or
	obtain utilities without your permission.


In some cases, thieves may have received medical services in your name, re-routed your tax refund, or even impersonated you during contact with law enforcement.

Identity theft may also include someone using checks on your account. This could be from stealing your checkbook or electronically obtaining access to your checking account. Use of an ATM card or credit card that you did not approve is also identity theft.

In some cases, identity theft occurs within families to children, seniors, and domestic violence survivors, making reporting and recovery especially difficult.

How Might it Impact Me?

Even if you are able to resolve a financial identity theft issue with your bank, this use of your name and credit history can result in you getting collection letters for things you did not purchase.&nbsp;

It can also result in unfavorable entries on your credit report, causing you problems in getting credit or paying a higher interest rate.

Becoming the victim of an identity theft can be a complicated and frustrating time in your life.

What Can I Do?

The Federal Trade Commission has created letters (in this booklet) that consumers can use to notify a debt collector or credit bureau of the theft of your identity.

To use the letters, you must first report the crime of identity theft to the police.&nbsp; You do not need to know the name of the person who used your identity. You show the police the debt collection letters or other confirmation that you are the victim of this crime.&nbsp;

The three forms below use the FTC-created material.

751,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2315,Identity Theft in Idaho,Identity Theft,,Consumer,"In October 2011, Idaho Legal Aid Services (ILAS) was awarded funds to form the Idaho Coalition Against Identity Theft (ICAIT) to serve Idaho identity theft victims. The Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center awarded ILAS funds from the U.S. Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime to form a statewide Coalition comprised of agencies, nonprofits, businesses and individuals to improve services and outcomes for identity victims, particularly seniors and “near seniors” age 50 and up.One of ICAIT’s goals is to educate the public about identity theft and the needs of identity theft victims. Definitions of identity theft vary. Congress defined identity theft in the Fair Credit Reporting Act as “a fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information of another person without authority.” 15 USC § 1681a. Idaho law provides: “It is unlawful for any person to obtain or record personal identifying information of another person without the authorization of that person, with the intent that the information be used to obtain, or attempt to obtain, credit, money, goods or services without the consent of that person.” Idaho Code 18-3126.Types of identity theft include:Financial identity theft,the most common form, involves the unauthorized use of an individual’s personal information for financial gain. Thieves often use a victim’s existing account or open a new account(s) in their name. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the misuse of existing accounts makes up 75% of victim reports, with credit card accounts being the most commonly misused account. Credit card information is often stolen through skimming (using a data storage device when processing a card), phishing (pretending to be a financial institution to get account holders to reveal personal information) or card theft. Financial identity theft victims often face denial of credit, increased financial charges, inability to get a job, or even bankruptcy. To detect financial identity theft consumers should review statements for unusual activity and regularly check their credit reports for fraudulent accounts.Criminal identity theft occurs when someone uses the victim’s name and information as his own during an encounter with law enforcement. This could lead to warrants issued in the victim’s name or entry of a guilty plea in their name.&nbsp;Medical identity theft involves the unauthorized use a victim’s name or health insurance information to obtain medical services. Victims often face costly medical bills or are unable to use health insurance benefits exhausted by the thief. A victim’s life can be put at risk due to the thief’s medical information being made part of their medical record, supplying care providers with inaccurate health related information.Government identity theft occurs when an imposter supplies the information of another person to a government agency, such as the IRS, Social Security Administration, or Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to obtain work or benefits.Synthetic identity theft is the use of a victim’s Social Security number with another name and date of birth to create a new, fictitious identity. Synthetic ID theft occurs where a thief does not have or want to use the victim’s other identifying information. This theft can be difficult to detect because new accounts and other suspicious activity may not appear on the victim’s credit report.&nbsp;Identity assumption is the impersonation of another person on the internet, with the “intent to obtain a benefit or injure or defraud another.” NY Penal Code § 190.25. An example is creating a Facebook account using another person’s name and photos. Identity assumption has only been specifically addressed in California and New York state law.&nbsp;Victims of the different kinds of identity theft typically require different relief.Financial identity theft victims often need help negotiating with creditors to close or freeze accounts and stop collection on fraudulent accounts. They may need assistance contacting credit reporting agencies to get a Fraud Alert placed on their credit reports. A Fraud Alert signals potential creditors that someone else is using that consumer’s identity and requires additional steps to confirm an individual’s identity before issuing new credit. It also entitles the victim to a free credit report. An advocate can further assist a victim by helping them review their credit report to find suspicious activity and dispute fraudulent charges.&nbsp;Financial identity theft victims should file an Identity Theft Victim’s Complaint and Affidavit (Complaint) with the FTC, https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/, &nbsp;or 1-877-438-4338. This is an important tool because it collects critical information in a standardized format that is widely accepted by creditors and credit reporting agencies when victims dispute debts. When the Complaint is combined with a police report it becomes an “Identity Theft Report.”&nbsp; An Identity Theft Report allows a victim to: block fraudulent information from appearing on her credit report; prevent a creditor from reporting fraudulent information to a credit reporting agency; prevent a creditor from placing the debt into collection; obtain transaction documents (such as applications completed by the thief); and place a seven year fraud alert on the victim’s credit reports.&nbsp;Victims of criminal identity theft should contact local law enforcement to request fingerprints and photos for comparison with the identity thief. After providing law enforcement with proof of identity they can request a letter of clearance from the police to provide to businesses, agencies, and data brokers. Criminal identity theft victims may also need attorney assistance to get criminal charges expunged from their record.Medical identity theft victims should file a report with local police and get a copy of the report. The victim will want to contact their health care providers and make requests (not mentioning the issue of identity theft) to obtain their medical records. Review of the records should enable the victim to identify imposter records.&nbsp; The victim/advocate can contact each provider who gave care to the thief to request correction and flagging of the records. It is good practice to confirm that records have been corrected.Victims of governmental identity theft should begin by contacting the government agency at issue. The Internal Revenue Service, United States Postal Service, Social Security Administration, and several other governmental entities have units devoted to the issue of identity theft. A victim should request to speak to the unit that assists identity theft victims to determine how to proceed. It is also beneficial to request a copy of the agency’s records for the victim, so that imposter activity can be identified and reported.Identity theft victims do not just suffer financial loss. According to the National Crime Victim Victimization Survey, 53% of identity theft victims feel moderate to severe distress from the theft.[1]&nbsp; As this crime continues to grow in Idaho, it is important to understand all aspects of prevention and recovery. We need to look at the existing resources and determine where there are gaps in services and how we can improve on a statewide, system-wide, local, and agency level to provide the best possible outcomes for identity theft victims. The goal of ICAIT is to bring together stakeholders, remove service barriers, develop resources, and create a network that supports victims to recover.

No deje que lo engañen a pagar demasiado.Contrate a un inspector de casas apropiadamente calificado y con licencia para inspeccionar muy cuidadosamente la propiedad antes de que sea obligado a comprar. Determine si usted o el vendedor será responsable para pagar por las reparaciones. Si usted tine que pagar por las reparaciones, determine si usted las puede costear (pagar) o no.Investigue y compare al conseguir un prestamista y compare los costos. Sea sospechoso si alguien intenta dirigirlo a solo un prestamista.Lea todo cuidadosamente y haga preguntas. No firme nada que usted no comprenda. Antes de firmar consiga que un abogado especializado en la área de leyes de biene raíces revise su contrato y acuerdo del préstamo, consulte con un profesional de bienes raíces de confianza o pida ayuda de un consejero de viviendas con una agencia aprobada por HUD. Si usted no puede costear (pagarle a) un abogado, lleve sus documentos a una agencia de orientación de viviendas aprobada por HUD cerca de usted para averiguar si ellos le revisaran los documentos o si lo pueden referir con un abogado que le pueda ayudar gratuitamente o a costo bajo.Sea sospechoso cuando el costo de mejora de casa aumenta si usted no acepta el financiamiento del contratista.NO se deje persuadir por nadie a que haga una declaración falsa en su solicitud para su préstamo, tal como exagerar su ingreso , la fuente de su pago de enganche, falta de no revelar la naturaleza y la cantidad de sus deudas, o cuanto tiempo tiene en su trabajo. Cuando usted solicita un préstamo hipotecario, cada parte de informacin que usted dé debe ser exacta y completa. Mentir en una solicitud para una hipoteca es fraude y puede resultar en penas criminales.NO deje que alguien lo convenza a sacar más dinero de lo que usted puede pagar. Si usted se atrasa en sus pagos, usted corre el riesgo de perder su casa y todo el dinero que ha pagado en su propiedad.Nunca firme un documento en blanco o un documento cual contiene partes en blanco. Si la información es insertada por alguien más en el documento del préstamo después que usted lo haya firmado, usted quizás aún esté obligado por los términos del contrato. Inserte ""N/A"" (cual significa no aplicable) o tache las partes en blanco.Sea honesto sobre su intención de ocupar la casa. Indicando que planea vivir allí, cuando en realidad, no lo va hacer (porque usted tiene la intención de rentarle la casa a alguien más o mejorarla y después venderla) quebranta la ley federal y es un delito.Esté seguro que su pago hipotecario no es más de 30 % de su ingreso neto.

A Federal Trade Commission study of the U.S. credit reporting industry found that five percent of consumers had errors on one of their three major credit reports that could lead to them paying more for products such as auto loans and insurance.

Overall, the congressionally mandated study on credit report accuracy found that one in five consumers had an error on at least one of their three credit reports.

“These are eye-opening numbers for American consumers,” said Howard Shelanski, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Economics.&nbsp; “The results of this first-of-its-kind study make it clear that consumers should check their credit reports regularly. &nbsp;If they don’t, they are potentially putting their pocketbooks at risk.”

939,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2528,How to Serve Your Small Claims Papers,,,Consumer,"The Defendant must be served (given) a copy of all the papers you file in Small Claims Court.
If there is more than one Defendant in your case, each one must be served separately – even if
they are husband and wife.

In most cases the deadline to serve and file your Proof of Service is 30 days. Some courts allow up to 90 days after you file your Claim. Ask the clerk about your deadline.

Follow these steps: 

&nbsp; 1. Fill out the Proof of Service form. You can get it from the Court Clerk or online at: www.courtselfhelp.idaho.gov. (Click on Forms, then Small Claims.)

&nbsp; 2. Have someone 18 or older – not you – serve the Defendant. The Defendant can be served by mail or personal delivery. Read below to decide which is better for your case.


	For U.S. mail service

	
		If you pay a fee, the Clerk can have the Defendant served by certified mail, return receipt. Mail service can be less expensive than personal service.
		Warning! If the Defendant refuses to sign the return receipt or if someone who is not the Defendant signs, you will have to serve the Defendant again, using personal service. If this happens, the Clerk will notify you.
	
	



	For personal service, choose 1 of these options:

	
		Pay the Sheriff’s office (or the Marshal’s office for some
		counties) to serve the papers. You must tell them exactly
		where to find the Defendant. The Sheriff or Marshal
		will give you the Proof of Service.
		In some counties, you pay the Court Clerk and the Sheriff or Marshal gives the Proof of Service to the Clerk. Ask the Clerk how it works in your county.
		Pay a professional process server. You can find one online or in any phone book. You must:
		
			Give the server a copy of your court forms.
			Explain exactly where to find the Defendant.
			Ask the server to fill out a Proof of Service form. (Some process servers file the Proof of Service with the Clerk. Others will return it to you for you to file.)
		
		
	
	


If you do not know where the Defendant can be found, some process servers will investigate for you, for a fee.


	Ask someone 18 or older – not you or anyone else involved in this case – to personally give each Defendant a copy of your court papers.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File the Proof of Service

After serving, the server will fill out the server’s part of the Proof of Service form and return it to you. Then you must file the Proof of Service with the Clerk. Or you can file it at your trial or with your Affidavit.

If you miss your deadline to file the Proof of Service, or if you serve incorrectly, you can file your claim again. If you file again within 6 months of filing your first claim, you won’t have to pay another filing fee.

180,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/1283,Employee Pensions,Pensions,,Employment,"A pension plan is an agreement between an employee, their employer and, for  some jobs, the union. Sometimes, the employer contributes and sometimes the  employee does as well. Employers are not required to have pension plans. A  federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), sets  the standards for private pensions. It also provides guaranteed pensions in some  cases. Your Right to Participate You must be permitted to participate if you are 21 or older and have worked  for at least a year. This means your time at the job will be counted toward  qualifying for retirement benefits. Many benefit programs offer the safety and  convenience of depositing payment checks directly to your bank account. Your Right to Information ERISA requires that all plan rules be in writing. The plan administrator must  explain all facts and rules about your employee benefit plan. You can get the  plan rules, your employment records, and a statement of the credit you have  earned to date. You can then find out when you will be eligible for benefits and  can calculate the approximate amount of your benefits. You also may request  copies of the Plan and Trust and a plan description, which outlines your rights,  from the plan administrator. Eligibility for Benefits You earn credits by working in a job covered by an employee benefit plan. The  plan rules specify how much work an employee must do to earn a year of credit.  The rules also explain how many years of credits you need to qualify for  benefits. Payment of Pension Benefits If you have not done so, it is wise to contact your plan administrator about  pension benefits. The plan administrator has 30 days to give you written notice  of your benefit amount and when you are entitled to receive it. Some plans may offer early retirement benefits and disability benefits. Some  plans may give you a lump sum payment if the amount of your benefit is less than  $3500. When you select what type of retirement benefit you want, your spouse  will usually be notified and asked to sign a release or consent form. Most private employee benefits are taxable income once you start  collecting. Social Security and Pension Benefits Under some pension plans, Social Security and pension benefits are  integrated, which means that the amount of the pension can be reduced by all or  part of your Social Security check. Since 1988, plans are required to leave at  least half of your pension in the plan. Survivor's Pension Benefits Under most pension plans, employees can choose to have pension payments go to  their surviving spouses. Check to see whether survivor benefits and early death  forfeiture clauses are in your pension. Early death forfeiture means that your  spouse does not receive benefits if you die before the early retirement age in  the plan. If you die while you are eligible for employee benefits under an  employee benefit plan, your spouse may receive a death benefit. If you wish to  have someone else receive this death benefit, tell your plan administrator. Your Right to Appeal The plan administrator is required to let you know, in writing, if he or she  denies your application for benefits payments. The plan administrator must give  you specific reasons for the denial. You have the right to a full review of the  denial by all the trustees of the plan. If you are still unhappy with the  decision, you can file a lawsuit in federal district court."

156,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/1259,What is a Civil Protection Order?,Orders of Protection,,Family Law,"A protection order is a civil provision with criminal penalties. It can be obtained to restrict or prohibit contact between a victim of abuse and the perpetrator (Idaho Code § 39-6301). A protection order is a document issued by a civil court that orders the person who is abusing or stalking you to stop doing so. If the person violates this order they will be criminally punished by the court.You can apply for a protection order even if criminal charges have not been filed against the person harassing you, or if you have already obtained a Temporary Protection Order as part of a criminal proceeding.A family or household member can file for a protection order.A parent not claiming to be in immediate danger of abuse can obtain a protection order in her own name as petitioner for her child.Protection orders can temporarily modify custody orders issued.It is important to realize that these orders are temporary under a divorce decree.When deciding whether to issue a protection order in this circumstance, courts will apply the “best interest of the child” test. The Court will also require a showing by a preponderance of the evidence of an immediate and present danger of violence.Protection orders can last for any period of time, from 14-days to five years.A protection order can be obtained in one day by applying at the local courthouse and giving a sworn statement detailing the abuse. There is no fee for filing a protection order.If the reviewing judge finds there is a likelihood of immediate violence to the petitioner, the judge will issue a 14-day protection order.At the 14-day protection order hearing, you will be asked to detail the most recent incident of abuse only. Any evidence you can bring of this is helpful.While threatening phone messages from the respondent can be used as evidence, they are not admissible unless the phone number from which they came and the date and time they were made are available. If your cell phone or caller ID records this information, save it and bring this and the message with you to court.If the judge grants a protection order, police officers serve the alleged abuser with the order and a Notice of Hearing.The order IS NOT in effect until served. The respondent will be served by law enforcement within 24 hours as long as he/she can be located (it is your responsibility to keep in touch with law enforcement as to the whereabouts of the respondent until he/she is served).Once the protection order has been served, the abuser cannot come up to 1500 feet of you or your house. This distance is five football fields so the abuser should not be able to come onto your block. Make copies of the protection order and keep one with you at all times. Leave a copy at each address on the order.If the abuser violates the order, call the police immediately. If you have any witnesses to the violation (for example, if your neighbor saw your abuser drive by your house) let the police know.Keep a written log of violations and abuse and report all incidences of physical abuse to the police.After the 14-day order expires, you can attend a second hearing to have the order extended for 90 days. If the judge finds at this hearing that good cause exists, the judge will extend the order for 90 days.If you fail to attend this hearing, the order will be dismissed. If you wish to extend the protection order you must appear and testify at the 90-day hearing.If the 90-day hearing needs to be rescheduled due to a conflict, the temporary 14-day order may be reissued for the time necessary before the new hearing.While each party has a right to counsel, attorney representation is not necessary and no court or service fees are charged for either party.In addition to limiting or restricting contact between the two parties, the court can provide for custody and visitation of any children involved, award one party possession of the family home, order either party to undergo drug or alcohol screening, or order respondent’s participation in counseling and treatment.The respondent may be required to pay attorneys fees, and to reimburse the petitioner for costs incurred in bringing the action, including reasonable attorney’s fees (Idaho Code § 39-6306).Under federal law, a judge can, where appropriate, order law enforcement officials to confiscate firearms from a party found to be a threat to petitioner.The respondent may be restrained from contacting, molesting, interfering with or menacing the minor children whose custody is awarded to the petitioner (§ 39-6306).Relief will not be denied because petitioner used reasonable force in self-defense against the respondent, or because the petitioner or respondent was a minor at the time of the incident of the domestic violence.The protection order can be extended for up to one year where appropriate.Any out-of-state protection order will be honored in Idaho, without the necessity of formally registering the foreign order in Idaho."
281,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/1623,El proceso de la Orden de Protección,Orders of Protection,,Family Law,"El proceso de la Orden de Protección

Los tribunales (las cortes) de Idaho pueden ayudarle a una victima de violencia domestica a
través de las ordenes de protección cuales restringen o prohíben el contacto entre la victima del abuso y el abusador. Código de Idaho Sección 39-6301 et. seq.

Usted puede obtener una orden de protección en contra de un miembro familiar o un miembro de
su hogar. Un niño menor de edad en una relación de noviazgo también puede solicitar una orden de
protección. No hay ningún costo para solicitar la orden de protección.

La orden puede ser obtenida en un día por medio de solicitarla con la oficina del actuario de la
corte local y por medio de dar/hacer una declaración juramentada indicando en detalle el abuso. El
actuario tiene todos los formularios (formas) cuales se necesitan para solicitar una orden de protección.
La victima puede formular su solicitud para la orden de protección en el condado donde reside, el
condado donde reside el abusador, o donde se esté quedando temporalmente.

Si el juez que evalúa el caso determina que hay una probabilidad de peligro inmediato y presente
al solicitante, el juez expedirá una orden de protección de 14 días. Un agente (oficial) de policía le
entregará al supuesto abusador con la orden. Una victima puede pedir que su orden sea renovada por
otros 30 días. Una fecha para una audiencia será fijada automáticamente con la entrega de la orden de
14 días.

Si la corte determina en la audiencia que la/el reclamante está en peligro de violencia domestica
continua, la corte extenderá la orden de 90 días. Mientras que cada parte tiene el derecho a un
abogado, la representación por un abogado no es necesaria y no se le cobran honorarios de la corte o
de servicio a ninguna de las partes.

Si el abusador supuesto se presenta (comparece) con un abogado a la audiencia, y la victima
abusada no tiene un abogado, la victima tiene el derecho legal de pedir un aplazamiento para obtener
un abogado. Cuando esto sucede el Juez automáticamente extenderá la orden de protección cual
existe por un periodo para permitirle a la victima que contrate su propio abogado.

La capacidad de la corte para proteger.

La corte tiene la capacidad de:


	Restringir o prohibir el contacto entre la victima del abuso y el abusador;
	Proveer para la custodia y visitas de cualquiera de los niños involucrados;
	Temporalmente modificar ordenes de custodia expedidas según un decreto de divorcio o de custodia;
	Otorgarle a una de las partes la casa familiar y excluir a la otra parte de la casa;
	Ordenar a cualquiera de las partes a someterse a tratamiento o consejería de control del coraje; y
	Extender la orden de protección por hasta un año donde sea apropiado.
	Consejos para las victimas cuales se representan sí mismas
	Comuníquese con el refugio de violencia domestica local para pedir ayuda.
	Solicite la orden de protección lo más pronto posible después que haya ocurrido la violencia.
	Complete el formulario (forma) para la orden de protección, dando claros detalles y fechas de los incidentes de la herida física, abuso sexual, y/o detención ilegal.
	Vístase apropiadamente para ir a la corte.
	Siempre sea respetuosa y cortés con el Juez. Diríjase al Juez como ASu Señoría.@
	Lleve a la audiencia todas las fotografías, datos (informes) médicos, u otros documentos indicando el abuso físico o sexual.
	Lleve a la audiencia cualesquiera testigos a la violencia.
	Lleve a la audiencia las direcciones de su trabajo, las escuelas de sus niños, las guarderías de niños, o cualquier otro lugar de cual el abusador necesita ser restringido de entrar.

About Domestic Violence

Domestic Violence is a serious national problem. Between two and four million women are victimized--by intimate partners, family members, or household members--every year. In 1997, Idaho alone reported 16,447 crisis calls made to domestic violence shelters, 2,827 domestic violence offenses, 6,980 filings for protection orders, and 1,042 women seeking temporary refuge in domestic violence or homeless shelters.

Domestic Violence occurs in many forms. It may involve emotional or verbal abuse, denial of access to resources or money, restraint of activities or freedom (including isolation from friends and family), sexual coercion or assault, threats to kill or harm, and physical intimidation or attacks.

Domestic violence is not simply a family matter; it is a crime. If you are being abused, threatened, or harassed, there are many community and government organizations that can help you. And, if you or your family members are in physical danger, there are several places you can call to obtain immediate assistance.

It can be obtained to restrict or prohibit contact between a victim of abuse and the perpetrator.A distinction should be made between a civil protection order and a no contact order. A no contact order is an order from a judge in a criminal case. The civil protection order is obtained in civil court.The Hope Card program is for persons who have long-term (12 months or more) civil protection orders.&nbsp; A Hope Card is not a substitute for a protection order.&nbsp; It is simply a more durable and convenient means of providing pertinent information from the existing order.The Idaho Hope Card program was made possible by a Memorandum of Understanding between Attorney General Wasden’s office and the Idaho Sheriffs’ Association."

Idaho's Medicaid programcovers many items and services, including the full range of long-term care. People who haveMedicare coverage may also qualify for Medicaid.

Health
Other Senior Citizens",,Health,"For The Payment of Hospital and Medical Necessities and Other Necessities for Low Income PeopleWhat is County Assistance?If you are indigent and cannot afford hospital and medical care, including medications, or basic necessities such as rent, food, and utilities, then the county is required by law to assist you in paying for them. This is a ""last resort"" program. This means that the county will pay for these services or necessities only if you have no other way of paying for them on a temporary basis. If, for example, you receive Medical Assistance through the state, then that program must pay for your hospital and medical bills.Who is eligible for County Assistance?You are eligible for county assistance if you are unable to provide for basic necessities or you do not&nbsp;have enough income and resources to pay for necessary hospital or other medical expenses. The ability&nbsp;to pay for necessary medical services over a 5 year period would make one ineligible for county&nbsp;assistance. Things exempt under the law such as some personal property, govern-mental benefits such as Social Security, or the homestead exemption (which is the first $50,000.00 of equity in your house),&nbsp;cannot be counted as resources. For assistance with food, rent or utilities, or for assistance with medications for noninstitutionalized persons, you must also be a resident of the county to which you apply. For necessary medical services, you should apply with the last county in which you resided for six&nbsp;consecutive months or longer in the past five years. If you have not resided in any county for at least six&nbsp;months within the past five years, then you should apply with the county where you resided for at least&nbsp;30 days immediately before you incurred your medical costs. If you have not resided in any Idaho county&nbsp;for at least 30 days but have lived in Idaho for at least 30 days, then you should apply with the county&nbsp;where you last resided just before you received the medical services in question. If you are denied&nbsp;assistance for the reason that you are not a resident, the county's decision may be wrong and you should consult an attorney.How do I apply for County Assistance?You can apply for county assistance at the county courthouse or offices, or someone there can tell you&nbsp;where to go. You will need to bring with you all the papers proving your living expenses, monthly&nbsp;income, and the bills for which you are requesting assistance. Even if you are orally told the county does&nbsp;not or will not provide assistance for what you are requesting, always demand a written application and&nbsp;fill it out. If you are denied an application, consult an attorney.You should be aware that upon application for medical assistance, the county will attach an automatic&nbsp;lien to all of your real and personal property and on all insurance benefits to which you may be entitled.&nbsp;You should also be aware that you and members of your household who are not fully employed but who&nbsp;are capable of employment can be required to file an application with the Department of Labor and to use your/their best efforts to seek employment. Those who quit their jobs may be denied assistance. If a person is unable to work for medical reasons, you may be required to submit a medical statement&nbsp;verifying your inability to work.After the county has reviewed all your information, they will decide whether or not you are eligible for county assistance. This decision will be based on your family size, income, monthly expenses, resources, debts, and other factors. This decision must be in writing. If you are denied, the written notice must state the reasons why you were denied. If no reasons are given for the denial or if you disagree with the denial for other reasons, you should appeal and seek the advice of an attorney as soon as possible.When will I find out if I am eligible for assistance?In cases where you request help on non-emergency medical services, the county has 35 days from the day you submit your written application to decide whether or not to pay hospital and medical bills for&nbsp;services already received. For emergency necessary medical services, the county has 60 days from the&nbsp;date of the application to issue a decision.If you are seeking help with your rent, food, or utilities, the county should make a decision no later than 15 days after your first interview. However, the county should make an immediate decision if there is an emergency circumstance. The clerk has the authority to approve financial assistance for immediate necessities in excess of $200. An emergency circumstance might be a shut-off of your utilities, or a courtordered eviction.When should I apply for county assistance?Emergency: If there is an emergency, such as if you receive an eviction notice, apply immediately. If you&nbsp;have a medical emergency you should apply no later than 30 days after you were admitted to the hospital or obtained the medical care.Non-emergency: If you need necessary but non-emergency hospital or medical care, you must apply for&nbsp;assistance at least 10 days before receiving the services. You can apply for basic necessities at any time&nbsp;you have the need. Follow-up necessary medical services based on a treatment plan which has been&nbsp;approved by the Board may be paid for up to six months from the date of the original application.&nbsp;Beyond that, requests for additional treatment related to an original diagnosis must be filed within ten&nbsp;days before receiving the services.What will the county pay?The county will only pay what Medicaid would pay for your medical bills, but you do not have to pay the&nbsp;difference. For rent, utilities, food, and other non-medical expenses, the county may try to limit their help&nbsp;to the smallest amount possible. If the assistance they provide you doesn't meet your needs, you should appeal and see an attorney.&nbsp;Assistance for food, rent, or utilities may be limited to one month in a 12 month period.Will I have to pay the county back?You will likely be asked to pay back all or a portion of the assistance you received. What you pay back&nbsp;must be a ""reasonable"" amount based upon actual income and resources available to you and must be for a ""reasonable"" period of time such as three years of small monthly payments. You should insist on paying an amount you can afford. The county may also provide for work reimbursement.You should not sign a lien on your property or a promissory note for reimbursement without first&nbsp;consulting an attorney. If you are denied assistance because the county will not agree on a reasonable&nbsp;reimbursement agreement, you should appeal the decision and consult an attorney.What can I do if I am denied assistance?If you are denied assistance on a claim for medical bills, you can appeal by requesting a hearing before&nbsp;the county commissioners within 28 days from the date of the denial. You have the right to have a&nbsp;lawyer or other person represent you at the hearing. You also have a right to present evidence and&nbsp;question witnesses.If the commissioners rule against you, you may appeal in District Court within 28 days of the county’s&nbsp;final decision. A decision from the District Court may be appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court.If you are denied assistance for non-medical bills, such as rent and utilities, you can file a written appeal&nbsp;to the Board within 30 days of the Board's denial. If the Board denies the appeal, you have 30 days to&nbsp;file an appeal to the District Court.The advice on this page is very general. There might be special factors which affect your case, or&nbsp;you might have questions after reading this page. We urge you to consult an attorney about county&nbsp;assistance problems. If you cannot afford an attorney, contact the Idaho Legal Aid Services office&nbsp;nearest you."

Federal Fair Housing Act
Landlord/Tenant (Non-Federal Housing Programs)",,Housing,"“No Pets Allowed”

The federal Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services when necessary to provide equal opportunity for a person with a disability to use and enjoy a residential dwelling. Disability is defined under the Fair Housing Act as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.

If a property does not allow pets, a person with a disability can submit a Reasonable Accom-modation request to her housing provider and the housing provider must permit an assistive animal when necessary to provide the tenant with an equal use and enjoyment of the property. The person requesting the Reason-able Accommodation may need to provide documentation from a qualified professional (e.g., physician, psychiatrist, social worker) to prove they have a need for the assistive animal.

Know Your Rights!

Housing providers cannot ask a tenant who requires an assistive animal to pay a pet deposit or fee for their animal. The housing provider cannot require special training for assistive animals. Finally, the provider cannot inquire about the nature or the severity of the tenant’s disability.

Assistive Animals

Assistive animals help persons with physical or psychiatric disabilities. Assistive animals can include service animals, emotional support animals, or other animals that assist a person with a disability. The terms “service,” “support,” and “assistive” can be used inter-changeably to describe the different roles of assistive animals.

Service animals perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a physical, intellectual, or mental disability. Examples include: seeing eye dogs, an animal pulling a wheelchair, or hearing dogs. Service animals do not need to be registered with a service animal organization in order to be considered a “service animal.”

Support animals provide therapeutic benefit to a person with a mental or psychiatric disability. Support animals have been shown to be highly effective at mitigating the symptoms of disabilities such as PTSD and depression.
Assistive animals require no special training as it is often simply the presence of the animal that provides the benefit to the person with a disability.

Mobile Home Issues",,Housing,"What is a manufactured home?

A manufactured home is a structure formerly known as a mobile home. It is built to the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety standards set by HUD and displays a red certification label on the outside of each transportable section. The certification is available only to those homes manufactured after June 15, 1976, when the standards were implemented
and cannot be received for any constructed prior to this date.

The structure is built in a manufacturing plant and transported in one or more sections on a permanent chassis. In the State of Idaho, manufactured housing constitutes real property if the running gear is removed and (1) it becomes permanently attached
to a foundation, and (2) the owner records, with the county recorder’s office in the county where the home is located, a&nbsp; statement of intent to declare it as real property. (Idaho Code § 63-304.)

The structure must be transportable in one or more sections which, when in traveling mode, is at least 8 feet wide and at least 40 feet long, or when put together is at least 320 square feet and which is built on a permanent chassis and intended to be used as a dwelling with or without a foundation. (Idaho Code § 28-9-102 (53).

The Fair Housing Act and Fair Lending Act apply to manufactured housing the same as they apply to apartments and more traditional homes. More information regarding these statutes is available at www.idaholegalaid.org.

Lenders can not discriminate on the types of loans available to help finance the purchase of a manufactured home based on any of the protected classes, including: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status (the presence or number of children in a household) or disability.

Manufactured housing standards are created and enforced by HUD. HUD provides two types of consumer protection. The borrower must sign a HUD Placement Certificate agreeing that the home has been installed and set-up to their satisfaction by the retailer before the lender can give the loan proceeds to the retailer. After moving in, the borrower can call HUD at (800) 927-2891 to get assistance about the problems with construction of the home.

Financing Options

There are several alternatives to financing a manufactured home.


	The most common method is through a retail installment contract through the retailer.
	Government insured loans:
	
		Fair Housing Administration (Title I &amp; II)
		Veterans Administration
		Rural Housing Services under the U.S. Department of Agriculture
	
	
	Private lending institutions may also have loans available if the home does not qualify for other loans.

Reasonable Accommodation Defense",,Housing,"Introduction

The Federal Fair Housing Act (“Act”) (42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-19) prohibits discrimination inhousing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, and disability (as well as sexual orientation/gender identity if the housing provider or program receives federal funding. A housing provider’s refusal to make a reasonable accommodation that is necessary to afford a person with a disability the equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling constitutes disability discrimination and is a violation of the Act.

What is a Reasonable Accommodation?

A reasonable accommodation is some exception or change that a housing provider makes to its rules, policies, services, or&nbsp; regulations that will assist a resident or applicant with a disability in making full use of a housing program or dwelling. The requested accommodation must be necessary for the person with the disability to enjoy their dwelling unit or to fully use services offered to other residents. Examples of reasonable accommodations would include: permitting an assistive animal in a “no pet” property; permitting a live-in personal care attendant to reside with a resident with a disability; use of increased font size on notices from the landlord; or allowing priority assignment to a first floor apartment for a requester with limited mobility.

Reasonable Accommodation Requests and Eviction

Reasonable accommodation requests can sometimes be used to stop an eviction. This would be the case when the basis for the eviction is connected in some way to a disability. For example: an eviction because a wheelchair caused damage due to narrow hallways; an eviction for aggressive or disturbing behavior where the tenant has a mental illness; or an eviction for noise complaints due to loud television where the tenant is hearing impaired. Under the Act, a landlord cannot necessarily evict a tenant with a disability if based on behavior or characteristics related to the disability. If the tenant proposes an accommodation that would eliminate or reduce the impact of the lease violation, the landlord must make such accommodations where they would not be unduly burdensome.

If you receive an eviction notice connected to your disability, you should immediately contact an attorney or fair housing organization for further assistance. They can help you draft a reasonable accommodation request to address the housing provider’s concern. For example, a tenant who has a hearing impairment and has received a lease violation for noise could submit a reasonable accommodation request to allow him time to “cure” the lease violation by acquiring headphones for his television. Or, a tenant who is being evicted for aggressive behavior related to mental illness could submit a reasonable accommodation request to allow her more time to “cure” the violation by getting the assistance of a case worker to help her manage her mental illness. There are many creative ways reasonable accommodation requests could be used to cease eviction proceedings and preserve your tenancy.

This individual may also be responsible for costs incurred in restoring the modification to original condition. The housing provider may request that a licensed contractor be obtained to make the modifications and/or restorations. The housing provider may be responsible for the costs if federal funds are received. If you and/or your housing provider have any questions regarding these provisions, please contact your local Fair Housing Council.*A resident or applicant is entitled by law to a reasonable accommodation and/or modification when needed because of a disability of the resident, applicant, and/or a person associated with a resident or applicant, such as a guest. Housing providers must grant all requests for reasonable accommodations and/or modifications that are needed as a result of a disability if the request is not unduly burdensome or a fundamental alteration of the housing program. If a request is denied, you have the right to know the reasons in writing.There must be a verifiable disability involved in order for the household to qualify for a reasonable accommodation and/or modification. The housing provider can seek verification, but cannot ask about the nature or severity of the disability. Furthermore, the housing provider is required by law to keep all information about the disability confidential.A person has a disability if he/she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment.Most serious medically treated conditions are considered to be a disability. A disabled resident must still be able to meet essential obligations of tenancy – they must be able to pay rent, to care for the apartment, to report required information to the manager, avoid disturbing their neighbors, etc., but there is no requirement that they be able to do these things without assistance.Using the following forms will help you and your housing provider to better write the request and implement any follow up necessary. The forms include:A Request for a Reasonable Accommodation.This form is your request for a reasonable accommodation to be given to your housing provider. (For you to complete)A Request for a Reasonable Modification. This form is your request for a reasonable modification to be given to your housing provider. (For you to complete)Verification of the need for an Accommodation and/or Modification (For your health care provider, such as a doctor, nurse, therapist, or social worker, to complete).This form verifies your request and authorizes your medical provider to certify your status as a person with a disability and your need for the accommodation and/or modification.Approval or Denial of a Request for a Reasonable Accommodation and/or Modification.

The new rule requires that HUD’s core programs “are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.”&nbsp; In explaining the rule, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan stated: “HUD is working to ensure that our housing programs are open to all” and the rule states “clearly and unequivocally that LGBT [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender]&nbsp; individuals and couples have a right to live where they choose.”&nbsp; The new regulations were proposed in response to evidence suggesting that LGBT individuals and families do not have equal access to housing.Twenty states, D.C., and 200 localities have enacted laws prohibiting discrimination in housing on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, but Idaho has not acted. The final rule makes the following changes:&nbsp;Requires owners and operators of HUD-assisted housing, or housing whose financing is insured by HUD, to make housing available without regard to the sexual orientation or gender identity of an applicant for, or occupant of, the dwelling. This policy is being instituted in HUD’s rental assistance and homeownership programs, including the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance programs, community development programs, and public and assisted housing programs.Prohibits lenders from using sexual orientation or gender identity as a basis to determine a borrower’s eligibility for FHA-insured mortgage financing.Clarifies that all otherwise eligible families, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or gender identity, have the opportunity to participate in HUD programs.Prohibits owners and operators of HUD-assisted housing or housing insured by HUD from asking about an applicant or occupant’s sexual orientation or gender identity for the purpose of determining eligibility or otherwise making housing available. The rule does not prohibit voluntary and anonymous reporting of sexual orientation or gender identity pursuant to state, local, or federal data collection requirements.The final rule is available to review at www.hud.gov. The main provisions of the rule can also be found at 24 CFR § 5.105 and 24 CFR § 203.33.Healthy Housing and Fair Housing: Mold and Bed BugsA landlord has a duty to maintain a habitable premises. A rental unit with mold growth or a bed bug infestation may be uninhabitable, triggering the landlord’s duty to make repairs under Idaho Code § 6-320. Mold, bed bugs, and other issues that impact a tenant’s health may also implicate the Fair Housing Act. First, a fair housing issue will be implicated anytime less healthy homes are routinely rented to persons in protected classes more often than to persons not in protected classes. For example, if minorities, families with children, or persons with disabilities are more likely to be placed in the units in an apartment complex that have the most repair needs, that could result in a fair housing complaint. The second issue is that repairs needed due to health and safety concerns often exacerbate the conditions of persons with disabilities and could warrant filing of a Reasonable Accommodation request in order to get necessary repairs. This article examines two common health and safety issues encountered by Idaho tenants and provides tips for tenants who face these issues.&nbsp; Mold The presence of mold can make a unit uninhabitable and can pose a health and safety risk to anyone residing in the unit. A tenant’s first step should be to notify the landlord of the mold, in writing, and request that the condition be repaired. Under I.C. § 6-320(a)(5), a landlord must take steps to remove mold within three (3) days. If the landlord fails to make the repair within three days, the tenant could bring a suit against the landlord for damages and specific performance (a court order to fix the problem). If mold is exacerbating or causing a health condition that would fall within the definition of “handicap” under the Fair Housing Act, then a tenant could also file a Reasonable Accommodation request with the housing provider requesting to have the mold condition abated. In the alternative, the tenant could file a Reasonable Modification request with the landlord, for installation of a fan or exhaust system, if an area has a recurring mold problem.A common question regarding mold repairs is: “Who is responsible for the cost of the mold removal?”&nbsp; Generally, a landlord is financially responsible for those repairs resulting from normal wear and tear or resulting from the landlord’s failure to maintain the premises. A tenant, on the other hand, is responsible for costs of repairs resulting from damage caused by the tenant. In the case of mold, an example of a situation where the landlord would be required to pay for mold removal would be where the mold was caused by a landlord’s failure to repair leaking pipes, windows, or roofs. Whereas a tenant would be responsible for mold removal that was caused by creating high humidity in the unit without ventilation or mold that resulted from lack of cleanliness in the unit. In reporting mold to a landlord, a tenant should take photographs, speak to other tenants, and take other steps to help a judge determine what caused the mold.  &nbsp;  Tips for Tenants: Do a thorough inspection of the unit prior to signing the lease, keeping an eye out for any mold problems. Keep the unit ventilated. Clean vulnerable areas such as bathrooms, windowsills, etc., with a solution that will discourage the growth of mold.  Immediately report signs of mold, or conditions that cause mold (such as a leak), to your landlord and, in writing, request that the condition be repaired within 3 days. (See I.C. § 6-320(d)). &nbsp; Bed Bugs  A bed bug infestation can make a unit uninhabitable and pose a hazard to tenant health and safety. A landlord is required to promptly treat a unit infested with bed bugs, at least within three days of receiving notice from a tenant, pursuant to I.C. § 6-320(a)(5).&nbsp; If a landlord fails to remedy the bed bug&nbsp; infestation within three days, a tenant may bring a suit against the landlord for damages and specific performance. Landlords and tenants often dispute who is responsible for the costs of bed bug removal. Generally, landlords are responsible for costs due to normal wear and tear or lack of maintenance of the property; whereas tenants are responsible for damages resulting from their actions or negligence. In the case of bed bugs, a tenant is only liable for removal costs where a landlord can prove that the tenant in question was the source of the infestation. Tips for Tenants:Know the signs of bed bugs: dark brown spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, headboards, or couches; rust-colored smears on bed sheets or mattresses; itchy red welts.If you suspect bed bugs, talk to your neighbors to find out if they have bed bugs as well. If so, notify your landlord of the infestation, in writing, and preferably as a group.If no one else has bed bugs, notify the landlord of the problem in writing immediately. Document where you noted signs of infestation to help determine where it originated.If bed bugs are in a unit when you move in and the landlord refuses to treat for the bed bugs, you may have the right to break your lease.Bed bug removal requires tenants to prepare the unit prior to professional treatment. If a tenant has a disability that would make it difficult to make these preparations, the tenant as the right to submit a Reasonable Accommodation request to get assistance or more time in order to do prepare the unit. Reasonable Accommodation Requests and the Interactive ProcessA reasonable accommodation is an exception or change that a housing provider makes to rules, policies, services, or regulations that will assist a resident or applicant with a disability so they have equal use and enjoyment of a housing program or dwelling. The requested accommodation must be necessary for the individual with the disability to enjoy&nbsp; their dwelling unit or to use services offered to other residents. A resident or applicant is entitled to a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act when needed because of a disability of the resident, applicant, or a person associated with a resident or applicant, such as a guest. Housing providers must grant all requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed as a result of a disability and that are not unduly burdensome or a fundamental alteration of the housing program. If a request is denied, a tenant has the right to know the reasons in writing and the right to meet with the landlord as part of&nbsp; the “interactive process.”&nbsp;  The interactive process involves the applicant and housing provider engaging in a dialogue in order to come up with a solution that meets both the needs of the applicant and the needs of the housing provider. The “Joint Statement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice: Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act” states: “When a housing provider refuses a requested accommodation because it is not reasonable, the provider should discuss with the requester whether there is an alternative accommodation that would effectively address the requester’s disability-related needs without a fundamental alteration to the provider’s operations and without imposing an undue financial and administrative burden. If an alternative accommodation would effectively meet the requester’s disability-related needs and is reasonable, the provider must grant it. An interactive process in which the housing provider and the requester discuss the requester’s disability-related need for the requested accommodation and possible alternative accommodations is helpful to all concerned because it often results in an effective accommodation for the requester that does not pose an undue financial and administrative burden for the provider.”The purpose of the interactive process is to find creative solutions that allow persons with disabilities equal use and enjoyment of their home, even where the accommodation originally requested is not workable. As a housing provider, if&nbsp; you receive a request that would result in an undue hardship, rather than denying the request, you should schedule a meeting with the requester to discuss alternative accommodations.  It is also important to remember, however, that the person with the disability has the most accurate and complete knowledge of their disability, functional limitations, and what accommodation will best meet their needs. If the requester feels a proposed alternative will not meet her needs, continued negotiation may be necessary in order to find a solution that is less costly or administratively burdensome but equally effective in removing the barriers to the requester’s tenancy.Limited English Proficiency Tips for Housing Providers&nbsp;Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) must be able to effectively participate in or benefit from federally assisted programs and activities. All recipients of federal financial assistance must comply with&nbsp; Title VI’s LEP requirements. Financial assistance includes grants, training, equipment, and other assistance. The following are some examples of who must provide LEP access: state and local governments, public housing agencies, assisted housing providers, as well as Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnership Program recipients.It is important to have a plan to identify LEP persons. LEP persons are defined as: Persons who do not speak English as their primary language and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak, or understand English. One option for identifying LEP persons is through using “I Speak” cards, which allow a person to point to the language they speak. These cards are available through the Department of Justice at www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/Pubs/ISpeakCards.pdf.In determining how best to meet Title VI’s LEP requirements, a four factor analysis should be used, looking specifically at: The number or proportion of LEP persons eligible for your services;&nbsp;Frequency with which LEP persons come in contact with your program/office;The nature and importance of the program, activity, or service you provide (services such as housing, food, education, health care and other basic needs will have high importance and therefore greater need for LEP access); and&nbsp;Your available resources and costs.Housing providers and housing programs seeking to comply with Title VI will need to have access to competent interpreters. A competent interpreter is able to communicate effectively in both English and the other language, knows specialized terms in both languages, will follow confidentiality rules to the same extent as employees, and will understand their role as interpreter. Options to consider for meeting your interpreter needs: Hire bilingual staff, hire interpreters on a contract basis, use a language line telephone service, or use volunteer interpreters, if competent. LEP persons should be allowed to use a friend or family member if they so choose, but this option may not be appropriate in some situations such as where sensitive, confidential, or embarrassing information would be revealed.Title VI compliance, for those programs receiving federal funding, also requires translation of vital documents. If a language group is frequently encountered (e.g., Spanish in the Boise area), then vital and widely used documents must be translated. Some examples of vital documents:&nbsp; written notices of rights, hearing notices, eviction, leases and tenant rules, applications for services, and consent forms. Ensure that the translator you use is competent, and ideally, have a second translator check the translation.It is recommended that you provide written translations of vital documents for each language group that constitutes 5% or 1,000 persons (whichever is less) of the population eligible for your services. Where persons in a language group constitute 5% of the population of persons eligible for your services but fewer than 50 people, oral interpretation provided free of cost will suffice. For example, if a landlord provides HUD-subsidized housing and 5,000 people in the area are eligible for such housing, then written translations should be made available to any language group that constitutes 250 (5%) or more people out of the 5,000 eligible. If only 300 people are eligible for the provider’s services, then 5% of that population would be less than 50 eligible LEP persons, and only oral interpretation would be required. Taking these steps, called the “Safe Harbor” will constitute “strong evidence of compliance” with Title VI.Title VI compliance can be greatly advanced by developing a Language Access Plan, which is an implementation plan to address the needs of LEP populations identified in your four-factor analysis. Your Language Access plan can be either a written plan, or some other way to document your strategy for providing LEP access. Housing programs and providers should monitor and update their LEP Plans to assess changes in population, new vital documents, whether you are meeting LEP persons’ needs, and whether new staff have been adequately trained.Staff should receive regular training on LEP policies and on how to work with interpreters. Finally, steps should be taken to provide notice to LEP persons that LEP access is available by posting signs, engaging in outreach to LEP persons, and using bilingual or multi-lingual phone messages. Providing interpreters and translated materials not only complies with Title VI, but also is responsive to the needs of our customers and clients.&nbsp;The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban&nbsp; Development issued the following press release regarding a disability discrimination case; excerpts of the release follow.HUD Orders West Virginia Landlord To Pay $34,000 For Discriminating Against Man With Autism And His SisterHUD Secretary found that landlord discriminated based on disabilityA West Virginia woman caring for her brother who has autism knew something was wrong when she tried to rent an apartment in Charleston from landlord Michael Corey in 2009. The landlord demanded that before he would sign a lease agreement, the woman must purchase a $1 million insurance policy to cover any damages or injuries caused by her brother and sign an agreement assuming all legal liability for her brother’s actions. In addition, the landlord required the woman to obtain a doctor’s note regarding her brother’s condition. The woman, believing she was being discriminated against, filed a fair housing complaint with HUD.The landlord admitted at trial that he does not require non-disabled applicants to meet the same requirements and acknowledged that it was his belief that “persons diagnosed with autism and mental retardation pose a greater risk in terms of liability.”&nbsp; HUD determined that although the landlord had never met the woman’s brother, he worried that the brother, because he has autism, would start a fire or attack neighbors.The woman, who is the legal guardian and primary caretaker of her brother, stated, “My brother’s one of the most loving persons you’ll ever meet. He’s a human being and the idea he would harm anyone else brings me to tears.”HUD Secretary&nbsp; Shaun Donovan found that the landlord violated the Fair Housing Act and ordered him to pay $34,000, which includes $18,000 in damages to the woman and $16,000 in civil penalties to the government.SURVEYPlease fill out&nbsp; a short survey to help us determine content of future newsletters and to help us gauge the effectiveness of this newsletter. http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/BBP7TWY &nbsp;Fair Housing:Your Home, Your ChoiceFair Housing laws give you the power of choice!To learn more about fair housing:Idaho Legal Aid Services Inc.Fair Housing Hotline1-866-345-0106 (toll-free)TTY 1-800-245-7573Fair Housing Portalhttp://www.idaholegalaid.org/FairHousingPortalTo file a fair housing complaint:&nbsp;Intermountain Fair Housing Council(208) 383-0695 in Boise or&nbsp;1-800-717-0695 (toll free)U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD)1-800-669-9777 or 1-800-927-9275 (TDD)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “The work that provided the basis for this publication was supported by funding under a grant with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Reasonable Accommodation Defense",,Housing,"A reasonable accommodation is some exception or change that a housing provider makes to rules, policies, services, or regulations that will assist a resident or applicant with a disability in taking advantage of a housing program and / or dwelling.A reasonable modification is an alteration to the physical premises allowing a person with a disability to overcome obstacles that interfere with his or her use of the dwelling and/or common areas.The accommodation and/or modification must be necessary for the individual with the disability to enjoy and/or fully use services offered to other residents and/or the individual dwelling unit.Reasonable accommodations can include but are not limited to:A change in the rules or policies or how a housing provider does things that would make it easier for you to live in the dwellingPermitting a service animal for a household in a community where pets are not allowed, or not charging a deposit for a service animal though the housing provider charges deposits for petsPermitting an outside agency to assist a disabled resident to meet the terms of the leasePermitting a live-in Personal Care Attendant to live with a disabled resident who might need 24 hour assistanceA change in the way a housing provider communicates with or gives information, such as increasing the font size of typed documents to a person with a visual impairmentReasonable modifications can include, but are not limited to:A structural change or repair in your apartment or another part of the apartment complex that would make it easier for you to live in the dwelling;Altering your apartment so that the unit can be accessed and used by a person in a wheelchair.*NOTE: The individual requesting the modification may be responsible for the costs incurred in providing a reasonable modification to the premises. This individual may also be responsible for costs incurred in restoring the modification to original condition. The housing provider may request that a licensed contractor be obtained to make the modifications and/or restorations. The housing provider may be responsible for the costs if federal funds are received. If you and/or your housing provider have any questions regarding these provisions, please contact your local Fair Housing Council.*A resident or applicant is entitled by law to a reasonable accommodation and/or modification when needed because of a disability of the resident, applicant, and/or a person associated with a resident or applicant, such as a guest. Housing providers must grant all requests for reasonable accommodations and/or modifications that are needed as a result of a disability if the request is not unduly burdensome or a fundamental alteration of the housing program. If a request is denied, you have the right to know the reasons in writing.There must be a verifiable disability involved in order for the household to qualify for a reasonable accommodation and/or modification. The housing provider can seek verification, but cannot ask about the nature or severity of the disability. Furthermore, the housing provider is required by law to keep all information about the disability confidential.A person has a disability if he/she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment.Most serious medically treated conditions are considered to be a disability.

Like many people in their 70s, Howard “Hop” Symons retired to Florida. His move to Sanibel Island in 1990 was possible only because of Sanibel’s Below Market Rate Housing program, which provides subsidized rates to people who have limited incomes. Symons, a West Point graduate and veteran, lived happily and without incident in his one-bedroom apartment until October 2002, when he received a notice that a management committee had made a “unanimous decision not to reevaluate [him] for a new lease. . . . The committee . . . determined that [he did] not meet the program’s required independent living criteria[, which] includes such things as care of self and care of the apartment.” Both the city code1 and the lease, it turned out, permit termination of the lease when the management determines that a tenant is “incapable of independent living.”

Mr. Allen acknowledges the research and recommendations of Leslie Davis, University of California Davis School of Law, Class of 2004, in preparing this article.Symons protested and provided detailed letters from his doctors and pharmacist saying that he was capable of independent living. One described how Symons, at 82, rode his bicycle to appointments. The apartment management, having done no medical assessment of its own, brushed aside these expert opinions and began an eviction case.
Housing discrimination against the elderly is usually based on actual, perceived, or past disabilities of the older person, as Symons’s case illustrates. To adequately enforce the fair housing rights of vulnerable elders, a lawyer must understand and be able to apply the laws prohibiting disability-based discrimination in housing.
The primary source of legal protection for elders is Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act (FHA).2 While age is not a protected class under the act, disability is.3 In passing the act, Congress “repudiate[d] the use of stereotypes and ignorance” and rejected “[g]eneralized perceptions about disabilities.”4 In other words, Congress felt so strongly about eradicating bias that it prohibited discrimination against people who were only perceived to have disabilities, and prescribed sanctions for such behavior that are no less powerful than those for real disability discrimination.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates there may be as many as 2 million instances of housing discrimination each year,5 but only about 25,000 FHA complaints are filed annually, most through private fair housing enforcement agencies.6 A recent study by the National Council on Disability suggests that the administrative enforcement mechanisms at HUD and at some state and local government enforcement agencies are underfunded and performing poorly.7 This makes the FHA’s private cause of action even more important.8 The FHA allows recovery for compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorney fees.9Elders who have suffered discrimination are increasingly turning to the FHA and the Americans with Disabilities Act to secure greater housing opportunity and choice of housing type, from rental apartments to senior-living and assisted-living communities to nursing homes. These plaintiffs may encounter significant resistance from landlords, service providers, family members, and policy makers.10 In the approaching era of tumult, trial lawyers will play a critical role in determining how effectively elders’ housing rights will be enforced.
The FHA is an equal-opportunity statute; it protects people’s choice to live where they want to live. That principle is easy to understand in the context of a real estate agent who turns an African-American family away from houses in predominantly white neighborhoods, or a rental manager who will not rent to families with children. For seniors and younger people with disabilities, equal opportunity means having a broad spectrum of housing choices—including single-family homes, condominiums, and rental communities—in a variety of settings that include people of all ages and abilities living side by side. In addition, people who are older or have disabilities may need or want housing that offers support and medical services for their special needs.Historically, as people aged, they faced a stark choice between staying in their own homes or moving to nursing homes or other service-intensive settings. During the last two decades, however, an ever-broadening range of options has emerged to allow seniors to remain in their homes longer, or to make the transition more gradually into communities that have graduated levels of care and services intended to respond flexibly to need.
In the past, advocates in the fields of disability and aging have sometimes taken different approaches to the legal issues arising from this trend. Disability advocates’ views tend to be “informed by the rising disability rights movement, with its twin pillars of self-determination and consumer direction . . . [and an emphasis on using] administrative and judicial mechanisms . . . to enforce civil rights and consumer protection laws in case of violations.”11 Advocates for older people may have a perspective “colored . . . by a history of neglect in long-term care facilities, and the conviction that an unfettered free-market system for long-term care services will not benefit the vast majority of seniors.”12 The FHA provides a framework for balancing these perspectives and for protecting the rights of both individual older persons and the institutions and agencies that wish to serve them.
The fair-housing framework
To meet the statutory definition of disability, a person must have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, have a record of such an impairment, or be regarded as having such an impairment.13 The second and third prongs of the definition can be especially helpful in addressing the prejudices of housing providers, who may refuse to rent to an older person because of generalized misconceptions about elders’ health and abilities. In fact, it is this third prong that applies to Symons’s case.
Because the FHA defines its coverage through the broad term “dwelling,” it applies to virtually every kind of housing.14 Courts have held that it applies to the spectrum of housing in which older people live, including retirement communities, condominiums, apartment complexes, cooperatives, assisted-living facilities, and nursing homes.15 It applies at every stage and to every transaction in the housing process, from the advertising and sale of homes to application, admission, terms and conditions of occupancy, and evictions.16Seniors are most vulnerable to discrimination at several transition points in their lives, such as at retirement or when they experience an increase in physical or mental impairments. To simplify their lives, older people may make a transition from home ownership to renting or simply move to smaller quarters. Or they may seek housing that is suited to retirement living, either because of the community’s characteristics or the services it offers.Many seniors experience blatant discrimination when they seek admission to new housing communities. A Texas couple was denied admission to a subsidized apartment complex because the husband was blind and partially paralyzed. In denying their application, the owner wrote that the property had a long-standing policy under which “rental units have been made available to only ambulatory senior citizens.”17
After investigating the surviving widow’s complaint under the FHA, HUD determined that there was cause to believe discrimination had occurred and referred the case to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for prosecution. In denying the defendant’s motion for summary judgment in the case filed by DOJ, the federal court made clear that the FHA does not permit discrimination against seniors with disabilities.
Few housing providers hang up a sign that says “no frail elderly.” Most do not discriminate as obviously as that Texas landlord. However, application policies may bar older people just as effectively and in ways the potential resident may not even know are illegal. Housing providers may not require applicants to demonstrate that they are “capable of living independently,” ask questions about an applicant’s medical history, or require an applicant to sign a statement agreeing to move out if personal care is ever needed. Since at least 1990, courts construing the FHA have consistently held that independent-living criteria are forbidden,18 and they have forced violators to pay hefty damages and civil penalties.19 Given the smoking gun in Symons’s case—the independent- living requirement in the lease and the city code—he should be successful in his pending litigation, as should the DOJ, which has indicated an interest in the case because of indications there is a pattern or practice of discrimination.
These types of illegal requirements are especially pernicious because both the housing provider and the applicant may believe they are “for the good” of the older person. The FHA explicitly prohibits inquiries into the “nature or severity” of a disability, yet we have frequently been told that the information is being elicited to “help” the applicant.20 Housing providers must base their decisions on whether the applicant can meet the tenancy obligations: paying rent, complying with reasonable residential rules, not damaging the premises, and not unduly disturbing others.21 The tenant is free to meet the obligations of tenancy with or without assistance. Just as a tenant may hire a maid to clean the house, so may he or she rely on family members, social service workers, or paid service providers.
The FHA also prohibits steering applicants to one building or floor based on their disabilities or perceived disabilities.22 Statements and policies such as, “We like to put all our wheelchair and walker tenants on one floor, so the other tenants don’t feel that they are living in a nursing home” or “You don’t want that apartment near the pool and tennis courts because it will be too noisy for you and you won’t use the facilities anyhow” violate the law.The FHA also forbids discrimination in the “terms, conditions, or privileges”23 of tenancy. In other words, landlords cannot treat older people with disabilities less favorably than tenants without disabilities. A woman in Minnesota suffered such discrimination when the owner of her “senior apartment” community decided to require all users of motorized wheelchairs to have liability insurance as a condition of continued tenancy. No similar requirement was imposed on people without mobility impairments or people who used other devices, such as manual wheelchairs, walkers, or canes.In assessing the discrimination claim, an administrative law judge found that the landlord had adopted the policy without empirical evidence that users of motorized wheelchairs posed a risk of harm to themselves or others, and struck down the requirement as discriminatory under the FHA.24 Likewise, residents cannot be prohibited from using wheelchairs, walkers, or other equipment in common areas.25
Beyond avoiding overt acts of discrimination, housing providers must also take affirmative steps to accommodate people with disabilities so they can use and enjoy the premises. The FHA requires architects, developers, builders, and landlords to comply with basic accessibility standards.26 In addition, a landlord who refuses to permit physical modifications or make reasonable accommodations in rules and policies violates the FHA.27The concept of reasonable accommodation may seem foreign to many housing providers because it requires them to make exceptions for people with disabilities that would not be made for other residents. But a reasonable accommodation for a senior citizen can often be the difference between continuing to live in the community and entering a nursing home. With the help of a live-in aide, he or she may be able to stay in his or her own home. Where there are limits on occupancy or unit size, such as in a retirement community for people 55 and over,28 or subsidized senior housing, a resident might be entitled to an accommodation in the occupancy rules to have someone move in to help with round-the-clock personal care needs. Or, through home visits by a mental health therapist, an assisted-living resident may avoid being transferred to a more restrictive setting. Another resident might need notices sent in large print or on audiotape because of failing eyesight. Still another might be able to “age in place” by getting a designated parking space close to his or her apartment.29
Once a request for accommodation has been made, it is the landlord’s responsibility to reply. A failure to respond (or an inordinate delay) has been held to violate the FHA.30 Courts have generally ruled that a housing provider must grant a requested accommodation unless the provider can demonstrate that doing so would constitute an “undue financial and administrative burden”31 or amount to a fundamental alteration of the service being provided.32 The failure to provide a reasonable accommodation constitutes an illegal act of discrimination and can be the grounds for a lawsuit.33
In one example, after retiring to a Florida condominium, a couple lived an active life until the man experienced a stroke that left him unable to walk. They had trouble maneuvering his wheelchair on the loose-pebble parking lot and stairs in the community. He requested permission to park a wheelchair van in the lot, install a walkway and a ramp or wheelchair lift, and store a golf cart on the property and run an electrical line to it. The condominium association used delaying tactics to avoid permitting any of the accommodations. In adjudicating a complaint under the FHA, an administrative law judge required the association to make reasonable accommodations, submit copies of all board and association minutes and any tenant requests for modifications to their units to the regional HUD office, and pay civil and compensatory damages and attorney fees.34Another frequent issue is whether older residents are entitled to have service or emotional-support animals even if the housing provider does not allow pets.
A person with a disability may be entitled to have an animal as a reasonable accommodation if he or she can show that this ameliorates the disability’s effects and improves his or her use and enjoyment of the premises.35 Service animals—such as guide dogs, hearing dogs, and assistive dogs—must be permitted,36 but so must emotional-support animals.37 For instance, an older widow with an anxiety disorder might be unable to live in an apartment without a dog to provide a sense of security. Another person suffering from severe depression might need the companionship of a cat. Residents with service animals that are permitted as reasonable accommodations must still comply with tenancy obligations, and their animals may not destroy the premises or attack people.38
Because a housing provider is not permitted to inquire about disability, and an applicant or resident is not required to disclose one, the provider may not learn of a resident’s disability until he or she requests an accommodation. No matter when this occurs, the obligation to provide reasonable accommodations exists at every stage of the relationship, right until its end. Attorneys have been successful in preventing the eviction of older tenants by requesting reasonable accommodations, even in cases involving serious housekeeping violations,39 rules violations,40 and physical confrontations with management, staff, or other residents.41 In addition to changes in rules, housing providers may need to permit physical changes to property used by an older person, at that person’s expense.42 Typical modifications might include placing grab bars in the bathroom, installing a roll-in shower, lowering countertops and removing below-countertop cabinets to allow room for a wheelchair, installing a ramp, widening a door to allow a scooter to pass through, or installing an automatic door opener.
If a modification would affect the unit’s marketability when the resident moves out, the housing provider may require a reasonable escrow sufficient to restore the unit to its prior condition.43 Failure to permit the modification is a violation of the FHA and grounds for litigation.
Enforcement
The FHA may be enforced in three ways:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by HUD through an individual complaint or on its own initiative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the DOJ where there is a pattern and practice of discrimination
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by litigation brought by an individual in federal or state court.
Unlike employment discrimination cases, FHA cases do not require plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before filing. In addition, there is concurrent jurisdiction, so they can file a HUD complaint and a civil complaint simultaneously. A HUD complaint must be filed within one year of the alleged violation. A civil action must be filed within two years of the alleged violation and before a HUD administrative hearing begins. Whether to file with HUD, in court, or concurrently is a strategic decision that depends on factors such as the timeliness and effectiveness of action by HUD or the state agency (which varies by administration and funding),44 the need of the individual, and the general advantages and disadvantages of administrative proceedings versus litigation. Many practitioners file with HUD first as a form of informal discovery and then file in court if HUD is unable to conciliate.In some elder-housing cases there is direct evidence of discrimination. Although current societal attitudes may inhibit people from overtly expressing racial or ethnic animus, prejudice against older people and those with disabilities is still frequently spoken out loud. A daughter may be told, “Your mother would be better off in a nursing home.” A co-op agreement might explicitly require that shareholders “agree not to obtain any home health care without the express approval of the board of directors.” Or a request for reasonable accommodations or physical modifications may be denied in a written response. These cases can be slam-dunk winners, or liability may be decided on summary judgment.
Where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, indirect evidence may establish a prima facie case.45 If housing was denied based on disability, indirect evidence would show that the person is disabled (or is perceived as disabled or has a history of being disabled), applied for and was qualified to rent or buy the property and was rejected, and that the housing remained available.46Once the prima facie case has been established, the defendant has to produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. The burden of proof would then shift to the plaintiff to show that the reason given is pretextual.47
One way of establishing a prima facie case is to use a tester: Have someone with characteristics similar to the potential plaintiff’s, but not in the protected class, apply for the same unit. If the tester is offered the unit, there is good evidence that the sole reason for rejecting the applicant was his or her protected class status. Many local agencies receive funding from HUD or local governments to perform fair-housing testing like this.Plaintiffs can also use disparate impact to establish liability. The circuit courts have set different standards for establishing disparate impact.48In a civil action, relief under the FHA includes actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorney fees. HUD may also assess a civil penalty to vindicate the public interest.49
Fair housing and trial attorneys
Trial attorneys are uniquely situated to advance the remedies and protections of the FHA. They have experience presenting cases that maximize the types of damages this statute expressly authorizes. In awarding compensatory damages, courts have ruled that victims of housing discrimination are entitled to damages for mental distress as well as actual damages.50In addition, a plaintiff attorney can often prove a good case for punitive damages.51 Housing providers have had 15 years to comply with the law, and many have received training in how to do that through HUD, local governments, provider organizations, or Realtor associations. Punitive damages may be the only way to ensure that the discrimination does not recur. The FHA’s provision for attorney fees has also been generously applied.52
As the Supreme Court has unanimously held, the FHA’s provisions are “broad and inclusive,” implementing “a policy that Congress considered to be of the highest priority,” requiring “a generous construction” of the statute.53 By making creative use of the law, trial lawyers can protect vulnerable elders from illegal discrimination, preserving their homes and extending their lives.

Renters face many problems in these properties, everything from utility shut-offs to eviction and loss of security deposits. The stories are heartbreaking: seniors forced to live without basics like running water, rent-paying tenants evicted with little or no notice, and families pushed into homelessness for no good reason. Banks typically evict all residents after foreclosure. Thousands of renters are being driven from their homes so that properties can sit vacant.The scope of the problem is staggering. Tenants Together conservatively estimates that at least one third of residential units in foreclosure in California are rentals. This means that more than 225,000 renters in California lived in properties that went through foreclosure in 2008 alone.These figures understate the problem because they are based on data collected from county records. Bysurveying callers to our Tenant Foreclosure Hotline, we found that many renters live in properties incorrectly labeled “owner-occupied” in the county-based data. The ‘at least one third’ estimate that we announce in this report appears to be just the tip of the iceberg. We are confident that further research based on actual property usage, as opposed to county records, will show a significantly higher percentage of foreclosed properties occupied by renters.This report describes the scope of the problem, provides an overview of common hardships endured byCalifornia renters in foreclosed properties, and proposes solutions. Among the various proposals, we note that “just cause for eviction” laws are a particularly effective and cost-free way to stop the unjustdisplacement of innocent renters after foreclosure who seek nothing more than the right to continue living in their homes as rent-paying tenants."

UPDATE ON THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT

In February of 2012, 49 state attorneys general and the federal government announced a joint state-federal settlement with the country’s five largest servicers: Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. The agreement settled state and federal investigations into “robo-signing” a practice wherein servicers were found to have signed foreclosure documents outside the presence of a notary public and/or without actual knowledge of the veracity of facts alleged in the documents they signed.

Nearly one year after the settlement was reached, 621,712 borrowers have received some type of consumer relief with total relief amounting to $50.63 billion. Of those 621,712 borrowers, over 380,000 have received relief specifically to help them retain their homes, including: loan modifications, principal forgiveness, and second lien extinguishments. These statistics come from new reports issued by the Monitor of the National Mortgage Settlement, Joseph A. Smith, Jr.

According to the Monitor’s reports, more than $22.48 billion of the overall completed consumer relief has come in the form of debt forgiveness. Because of the settlement, principal reduction has become more common and helps borrowers stay in their homes, lowering monthly payments on over 266,000 loans and actually reducing struggling homeowners’ loan balances by more than $81,000 on average. ""As we reach the one year anniversary, the latest report marks a major milestone in our efforts to assist struggling homeowners,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We have already surpassed our initial expectations and the settlement is testament to the fact that large scale principal reduction can be used an important tool in our efforts to prevent foreclosures.

In Idaho, cumulative consumer relief has topped $173 million. The five servicers have completed 496 refinances for Idaho homeowners with average rate reduction of 2.58%. In addition 244 homeowners received a modification with some form of principal forgiveness; 1096 homeowners received deficiency forgiveness through a short sale or deed in lieu; 645 homeowners had a second lien extinguished; and 122 homeowners received a forbearance due to unemployment.

You can read the Monitor’s full report and view the interactive state-by-state map by visiting www.mortgageoversight.com.

However, even though much progress has been made, there are concerns that servicing violations continue to occur and there are calls for greater oversight from the Mortgage Settlement Monitor. On March 27, 2013, a coalition of 109 civic groups sent a letter to the Monitor highlighting their concerns about lack of real change on the ground in the hardest hit communities and asking for more oversight.

The letter alleges that many homeowners are still finding it extremely difficult to get affordable mortgage modifications with principal reduction. In particular, the coalition points out that communities of color and low-income communities have been slow to receive relief. The letter requests that the Monitor collect and make public race, ethnic, and geographic data to ensure the servicers are meeting their full obligations under the settlement agreement.

“Communities of color were disproportionately targeted by abusive lenders, and they have been disproportionately hurt by the foreclosure crisis” said Lisa Donner, Executive Director of Americans for Financial Reform. “The cycle of discriminatory lending must be broken,” said Mark Ladov, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. “We need full transparency and accountability to ensure all borrowers, including communities of color, are receiving the help they need to stay in their homes.”

“The national mortgage settlement is supposed to bring relief to homeowners who were hardest hit by Wall Street’s malfeasance,” said Brian Kettenring of the Campaign for a Fair Settlement. “Unfortunately, the reports to date fail to provide any insight into whether the settlement is benefitting communities of color. Every week we see fresh evidence that the banks and servicers can’t be taken at their word: We need data and hard evidence that they’re doing what they’re required to do.”

THE FUTURE OF THE MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE PROGRAM

The Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, has helped more than 1.3 million homeowners at risk of foreclosure and has reduced mortgage payments significantly for these households, a median savings of $546 per month.

A coalition of 36 state and national organizations is asking the U.S. Treasury Department to reconsider ending the program in a letter sent to Jacob J. Lew, U.S. Treasury Secretary. The letter states, ""Research has shown that foreclosure and delinquency rates have disproportionately impacted African-American and Latino families, and median household wealth has dramatically declined. . . High foreclosure rates in communities of color have also impacted those homeowners neighboring foreclosed properties, and estimates show that these properties stand to lose $1 trillion in home equity as a result.""

Launched in 2009, HAMP initially sought to lower monthly mortgage payments to an affordable and sustainable level through a uniform loan modification process. HAMP funding was a part of the $29.9 billion authorized for the Making Home Affordable Program. Later in 2012, program options were expanded to focus on principal reduction modifications, expand relief for unemployed homeowners and ease other alternatives to foreclosures such as short sales. For example, HAMP's unemployment program offers a minimum of 12 months of temporary forbearance to allow these homeowners time to focus on securing new employment while still owning their homes. More than 30,500 homeowners have been assisted through this forbearance program.

The most recent HAMP program performance report shows that the program is working well and has been an effective tool to assist homeowners in avoiding foreclosure. Nationwide, the average non-HAMP mortgage modification reduced monthly payments by $389; while the average HAMP modification reduced the same monthly payments by $558. Similarly, non-HAMP servicers reduced interest rates in 73 percent of modifications made in the fourth quarter of 2012. Participating HAMP servicers reduced interest rates for 81 percent of borrows during this same period.

Coalition leaders are particularly concerned that ending the HAMP program at the end of this year will mean many of the hardest hit neighborhoods will not have had adequate time to take advantage of this program and significantly recover from the foreclosure crisis. In particular, high concentrations of foreclosures in neighborhoods of color has created a disproportionate burden on these communities throughout the foreclosure crisis. Coalition leaders agree: ""Effective housing policies must recognize that neighborhoods with higher foreclosure rates and deeper foreclosure-related impacts will take more time to recover.""

Fortunately, on May 30, 2013, Jacob Lew, Treasury Secretary, and Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, announced that HAMP, which was due to lapse at the end of 2013, has been extended through 2015. Mr. Donovan said of the program: “Families across the country have used its tools to reduce their principal, modify their mortgages, fight foreclosure and stay in their homes — helping further stimulate our housing market recovery. And with this extension, we ensure that the program keeps supporting communities for years to come.”

HUD LAUNCHES FIRST FAIR HOUSING MOBILE APPLICATION

New app will help the public, housing industry learn about their housing rights and responsibilities

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) unveiled the first housing discrimination mobile application (app) for iPhone and iPad. Developed by HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) and Hewlett Packard (HP), the app uses the latest technology to provide the public with a quick and easy way to learn about their housing rights and to file housing discrimination complaints, and inform the housing industry about its responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.

The app will also be an important tool to assist fair housing groups and other civil rights advocacy organizations in their efforts to help individuals pursue their housing rights and industry to educate their members on their responsibilities. Several groups indicated their intent to promote the app with their members and in communities where they work, including MomsRising, Illinois Department of Human Rights, Access Living, League of United Latin American Citizens, Asian Real Estate Association of America, National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, National Association of Real Estate Brokers, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

“Having this first fair housing mobile application equips people everywhere with the information they need to combat housing discrimination,” said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “We are maximizing the latest technology to make the process for filing fair housing complaints faster and easier and arming our fair housing partners with the information they need to understand their fair housing rights and responsibilities.”

HUD’s new fair housing app was unveiled during the 3rd Annual MobileGov Summit in Washington, DC, a conference which brings government and industry IT leaders together to discuss the latest trends and best practices for creating the next generation mobile government workforce.

“HUD needed an efficient and reliable solution to quickly extend existing capabilities to mobile computing devices,” said Marilyn Crouther, senior vice president and general manager, U.S. Public Sector, HP Enterprise Services. “The new HP application achieves operational goals of HUD – from concept to deployment – while more effectively addressing discrimination complaints. The mobile app simplifies and increases access to government services for people.”

In addition to facilitating real-time delivery of housing discrimination complaints to HUD, the app can be used by individuals researching their housing rights after a natural disaster, when power outages make the iPhone/iPad one of the few ways to access the Internet. The app also provides information about the fair housing complaint process, and allows the public to access HUD’s toll-free discrimination hotline and link to HUD’s fair housing website: www.hud.gov/fairhousing

In conjunction with the fair housing mobile application, FHEO has released HTML 5 adaptive mobile pages, which are in English and Spanish and allow web content to display properly regardless of the brand of smartphone or tablet being used. In addition, the adaptive mobile pages allow individuals to complete and submit the fair housing complaint form in Spanish. FHEO also plans to design a “Quick Response code” ad campaign, directing mobile users to the new adaptive pages.

HUD ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO SETTLE LGBT DISCRIMINATION CLAIM

BOA agrees to pay $7,500, correct practices for alleged discrimination against lesbian couple

To combat housing and lending discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development published a new rule in 2012: “Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs – Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity.” This new rule became effective March 5, 2012 and, in particular, prohibits lenders from using sexual orientation or gender identity as a basis to determine a borrower’s eligibility for FHA-insured mortgage financing. The rule, which becomes effective on March 5, 2012, defines ""gender identity"" to mean ""actual or perceived gender-related characteristics"" and ""sexual orientation"" to mean ""homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.""

In early 2013, HUD issued a press release that gave the public its first glimpse of HUD’s enforcement of this new rule. HUD claimed Bank of American (BOA) denied a loan to a Florida couple seeking to obtain an FHA-insured mortgage because of their sexual orientation and marital status. Because one partner was not employed, the applicant enlisted her partner’s mother as a co-applicant on the loan. The couple worked with BOA for several weeks to provide all of the necessary loan application documents and the couple was assured by BOA that they were likely to receive a mortgage. One business day prior to closing, BOA denied the mortgage because it did not consider the loan applicant and the co-applicant directly related because the applicant and her partner were not married. As a result of BOA’s actions, the couple was not able to close on the loan. Under the terms of the agreement between HUD and BOA, BOA agreed to pay HUD $7,500 and to notify its residential mortgage loan originators, processors and underwriters of its Settlement Agreement. In addition, BOA agreed to remind its employees that they are prohibited from discriminating against FHA-loan applicants on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status. BOA also agreed to update its fair lending training program to include information on HUD’s rule. Regarding the settlement, John Trasviña, HUD’s Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, stated, “The HUD Equal Access Rule means just what it says: one’s sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status is not a legitimate basis on which to deny a mortgage. Members of the housing industry should take note of this settlement agreement. HUD will enforce its regulations to make sure its programs are truly open to all qualified families.”

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in residential real estate-related transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. HUD continues to take enforcement actions in other areas of lending discrimination as well. Recently, HUD has reached several settlements in fair lending cases involving discrimination claims based on maternity leave. In one such case, SunTrust Mortgage had to pay two complainants $18,000 each after denying loans to a woman in Florida and a woman in Virginia because the women were on maternity leave. In a similar case, Primary Residential Mortgage, Inc. had to pay a woman $13,000 after denying a mortgage loan because the applicant was pregnant and on maternity leave.

ROLE OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU IN FAIR LENDING CASES

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is responsible for enforcing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination by creditors based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because a person receives public assistance. The CFPB has created an “Office of Fair Lending” within its agency to ensure that all Americans have fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit.

The Office of Fair Lending’s Assistant Director released a statement to let “both lenders and consumers know that in our examination and enforcement work, we will combat unlawful, discriminatory practices—including those that have an illegal disparate impact on protected borrowers. We will look not only at mortgage lending, but also at other types of credit including student loans, loans for cars, and credit cards. Access to credit is critical to a successful financial future. At the CFPB, we are committed to fighting unlawful, discriminatory practices and creating a fair marketplace for all consumers.”

On its website, the CFPB describes how it is different from other financial regulators: “Other regulators focus on the safety and soundness of the financial institutions first. The CFPB is the first to focus primarily on the American consumer.” The CFPB’s Office of Fair Lending is engaging in datadriven research and analysis of consumer financial markets and services; enforcement and oversight of federal fair lending laws; and promotion of fair lending compliance and education.

The CFPB also seeks to gather information from consumers to help identify and address widespread unfair lending practices. To that end, the CFPB’s website includes educational materials to help education consumers about discriminatory practices, a section for consumers to share a story about a good or bad experience with a financial product, and a section to submit a complaint.

DISABILITY AND LENDING DISCRIMINATION: OVERVIEW AND EXAMINATION OF RECENT CASES

The Fair Housing act prohibits lenders from discriminating against persons with disabilities. Prohibited practices include: requiring extra income documentation from people with disabilities when they have already demonstrated a steady source of fixed income and inquiring about the nature or severity of a disability. If a consumer files a fair lending complaint with HUD, the complaint is investigated and HUD may find that bringing an enforcement action in the case is warranted. Below are short descriptions of three recent disability discrimination actions taken by HUD or the Department of Justice.

On October 10, 2012, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Bank of America (W.D.N.C.). The Department of Justice complaint alleges that Bank of America violated the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by requiring mortgage applicants with disabilities to provide a letter from a doctor as a condition of credit. Bank of America requested letters that identified the disability or that stated the disability was permanent or that stated that disability payments would continue for three years. The settlement requires Bank of America to pay $1,000, $2,500 or $5,000 to eligible mortgage loan applicants who were asked to provide a letter from their doctor to document the income they received from Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). The HUD complainants will receive a total of $125,000 in damages.

On January 23, 2013, HUD announced that U.S. Bank National Association must pay $12,000 to a loan applicant with disabilities under a Conciliation Agreement settling allegations that the bank required him to provide unnecessary documentation to establish he would continue receiving disability income for three years before they would approve his mortgage loan.

A Roseville, Minnesota man filed a complaint with HUD alleging U.S. Bank asked him to provide proof that his disability income, including Social Security Supplemental Security Income (SSI), would continue for three years. The applicant submitted documentation from the Social Security Administration as part of his mortgage application. Additional documentation was not needed because Social Security award letters without expiration dates establish continuity of income for three years.

Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, U.S. Bank agreed to pay the man $12,000, accept SSI award letters as establishing at least three years’ income, and refrain from requiring applicants receiving disability income to provide doctors’ statements concerning the nature, severity, or duration of a disability.
""Holding persons with disabilities to a different standard because they rely on disability-related income violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Reasonable income standards are a necessary part of the underwriting process but HUD will continue to take action when these practices are discriminatory.""

Finally, on April 1, 2013, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement of interest in Gomez v. Quicken Loans, a case alleging that Quicken Loans discriminated against borrowers with disabilities by requiring that they provide a letter from a doctor as a condition of their loans. The Statement of Interest by the DOJ addresses defense claims that disparate impact claims are not permitted under the Fair Housing Act and that disparate treatment claims require proof of ill intent.

Many Land Trusts focus on single family housing whereby the Land Trust acquires the ground and provides a long‐term lease to the persons acquiring the home located on that lot. They typically target persons with income ranges from very low income to moderate income (using HUD median income guidelines). The effect of such programs is to greatly lower the cost of home ownership. The Land Trust usually includes some form of homeowner education and training, and often, upon resale of the home by the owner, shares in the appreciation in value. Appreciation is often reinvested into the home resale to ensure continued affordability of the property.CHARACTERISTICSLimited Equity Cooperative:The community residents continue to own their homes, which are not affected by the purchase process.Participating community residents own a share in the cooperative at nominal cost.The cooperative itself owns the community.Financing to the cooperative is from a consortium of community development lenders and other low interest loan sources.There is often a Technical Assistance Provider who organizes the community residents, coordinates the financing, and provides on‐going training and management guidance to the cooperative.&nbsp;Land TrustLand Trust community purchase models are less standardized than Limited Equity Cooperative purchase models.The Land Trust may purchase the entire community and operate it in a manner similar to a NFP Affordable Housing ProviderThe Land Trust may also purchase the community in conjunction with the residents, such that the residents own a long‐term leasehold estate on the entire community. (This portion of the transaction would be similar to a Limited Equity Cooperative.) Thus, the residents own and operate the community leasehold, while the Land Trust is a relatively passive investor receiving a lease payment. There are typically affordable housing conditions (such as home resale restrictions, both in terms of price and eligible buyers) attached to the transaction.ADVANTAGESThe low share price can lead to a broad‐based membership. Share price increases in the future are often limited.The availability of Technical Assistance provides the residents with operational and management guidance.This method may be the best purchase method for low‐income resident groups.This method provides a relatively high level of resident control, but requires high resident involvement, organization and responsibility.DISADVANTAGESBoth the LEC and Land Trust purchase process can take a long time because of the complexity of organizing the residents and the coordination required for the funding sources (sufficient local funding is very difficult to obtain). The community owner may be unwilling to wait for the transaction to be arranged.Each method requires a project manager (either a Technical Assistance Provider or the Land Trust staff) to coordinate the transaction. Such organizations may not be available locally, have no specific skills, or may be uninterested in becoming involved with manufactured home community projects.Limitations on the resale of homes (either or both as to the resale price of the home or as to eligible low‐income buyers) may discourage home upgrades and cause resident unrest.Sufficient community development funding sources may not be available.Very few (under 20) cooperatives exist in the western United States, so there is a long learning curve in terms of acquiring the skills to successfully using this method.PURCHASE METHOD –Mutual Benefit CorporationWHAT IS IT?A Mutual Benefit Corporation is an entity established under state law as a not for profit (NFP) corporation for the benefit of its shareholder/members. In the case of a manufactured home community, the residents in the community create a corporation and those residents who chose to participate purchase shares/memberships in the corporation. Residents choosing not to participate remain as tenants with the same legal status they had prior to the resident purchase. With this purchase method, the NFP corporation owns the community and the participating residents, in turn, own the corporation. This is similar to but not the same as a cooperative, which is also referred to as a Limited Equity Cooperative (LEC).This method is considered “Market Rate” due to the fact that most if not all the funding for the purchase is obtained from conventional lending sources, rather than subsidized (low interest rate) funds from sources such as the state, local government, affordable housing providers or technical assistance providers. This method is considered a reasonable purchase option because Market Rate funding is readily available. The typical funding types include a first mortgage loan made to the resident corporation, share loans made to individual residents needing financing for their share in the corporation, and equity from residents who can afford to pay cash for their share.CHARACTERISTICSCommunity residents continue to own their homes, which are not affected by the purchase processTypically 60% ‐ 80% of the residents participate as members, with the remaining residents continuing to rent home sites from the corporationParticipating residents are purchasing their share in the corporation and the right to occupy their site, subject to a long‐term membership agreement/lease.Members elect a Board of Directors of the corporation who oversee the operations of the communityThe Board hires a management company to run the day‐to‐day activitiesMembers along with the Board establish the rules of community operationsThe purchase process is relatively quick (the process can take under 6 months to complete)The funding provided has relatively few restrictions. The corporation is subject to state corporate law and whatever state manufactured home regulations apply to investor owned communitiesIn situations where state or local rent control applies, members are no longer subject to rent control, while nonparticipating tenants remain subject to rent controlTransfer of home/share ownership to new resident is relatively simpleADVANTAGESAttractive to community owners because the process proceeds rapidlyDoesn’t need 100% resident participation to succeedNo limitations on home resale pricesFunding is readily availableDISADVANTAGESRequires a larger investment by residents than some other methodsRequires a high level of involvement, responsibility and organization on the part of participating residents&nbsp;SUMMARY &amp; ISSUESMutual Benefit Corporations are mostly found on the West Coast and Florida. There are many reasons:Lender communities are receptive to this purchase method,Lack of Technical Assistance Providers with manufactured home community experience limits availability of other purchase methods,Interest by resident groups in this method is higher due to the lack of restrictions on the resale of homes,Financial and life experience backgrounds of residents tend to make groups view this purchase method as an attractive alternative,State laws permit or encourage Corporate ownership,Subsidized funding sources for other purchase methods are limited or nonexistent.&nbsp;PURCHASE METHOD ‐ SUBDIVISIONWHAT IS IT?There are several names for this purchase method, such as Subdivision, Condo, Fee Simple or Planned Unit Development (PUD) ownership. However, they all describe a situation where the community is divided into separate parcels and each parcel is then sold to the individual resident occupying that specific parcel. Usually an interest in the common area is sold with the parcel. There are typically three ways a subdivision of an existing Manufactured Home Community can occur:The community owner subdivides the community and sells individual lots to homeowners,The homeowners as a group approach the owner with a proposal to subdivide and purchase the community, or,An intermediary (such as a private company or local government) purchases the community in coordination with the resident group and then subdivides the community with sales to individual members.CHARACTERISTICSThe community residents continue to own their homeThe community residents own the land (or ‘condo air space’ rights) underneath their home,The community common areas and infrastructure are owned by all the participating residents together, usually through a homeowner association.ADVANTAGESSome residents considered this purchase method as attractive because it is ‘fulfilling the American Dream’ of dwelling ownership.Individual lot owners have limited involvement with their neighbors and have no concern if a neighbor has financial difficulties and limited concern if the community has issues.Although the homeowners association has a Board of Directors to administer the common areas and infrastructure, such a Board has limited control over lot owners, and conduct within the subdivision is governed by the Covenants, Conditions &amp; Restrictions (also called CC&amp;Rs) recorded when the subdivision is created.DISADVANTAGESIndividual residents must be able to afford to buy (or to finance, if appropriate) their lot, based upon their personal credit worthiness and income.Locating financing for the lot purchase may be difficult. Lenders interested in such financing may require that the home be placed on a permanent foundation.Lots in a Subdivision may be subject to higher property taxes.Local municipalities having jurisdiction over the subdivision may require upgrades for water, sewer, roads and storm water systems, resulting in individual assessments on each lot to pay for such upgrades.Actual completion of the subdivision process may take substantial time (often years before the final lot is sold) as each resident attempts to qualify for their lot purchase.Some residents feel forced to move from the community since they cannot afford to purchase their lot and the home/lot itself is in demand from potential new residents.Many homes in communities are older (pre‐1976) homes and such homes often do not qualify as collateral for financing. Consequently, even though a homeowner may believe that there is substantial equity in the home, such equity is not available to facilitate lot financing.Some owners (notably in California) are using the subdivision process as a pretext to force residents off of local rent control restrictions, resulting in higher site rents for those residents unable to purchase their lot.The process of valuing individual lots can be complex and may appear to be unfair – Is a large, doublewide corner lot with a view worth the same as an interior singlewide lot?Any debt on the community prior to purchase typically must be paid off (often with a prepayment penalty) since most loans will NOT allow the release of individual lots.Use of a financial intermediary can be very expensive, since the intermediary is purchasing the community from the owner, usually at a ‘market price’, and then adding the intermediary’s costs and markup to determine the lot price.SUMMARY &amp; ISSUESSubdivisions are currently found mostly in Florida, probably because of the high‐income nature of the resident groups in that state and the availability of lot purchase financing from local lenders. Information about other states is difficult to obtain. There some communities built as subdivisions in Texas. California has possibly 20 or more, mostly created in the late 1980s and early 1990s when appropriate financing was more readily available.This method (outside of Florida) of converting an existing manufactured home community to resident ownership may have a very high probability of failure. Not enough residents can qualify for financing, and amounts and sources of financing are often not available to ensure success.Here are some important questions you should ask any consultant that wants to help with your resident community purchase. Do not accept vague or incomplete answers to these questions:‐‐ How long have you been a community purchase consultant to manufactured home community resident groups?‐‐ How many communities have you helped convert to resident ownership?‐‐ Who owned these communities at the completion of the purchase? Were they owned by the residents themselves, or by some outside corporation?‐‐ Where are these communities? Please name them, so that we can contact residents there to learn how things have worked out.‐‐ When was your most recent community purchase completed? (Deals the consultant is trying to complete at the moment don’t count). Describe generally how mortgage financing was accomplished for that transaction. (If the consultant has not completed a deal lately, they may have problems arranging a mortgage loan in the current market).‐‐ Show us the specifics of how our community purchase would be financed. How much will need to be borrowed? Where will that money come from? Will it come from private or public sources? How much money would come from each source? Have you successfully arranged mortgage loans from these&nbsp; sources before? Give us some specific examples.‐‐ Can you provide us with “Expression of Interest” letters from the lenders who would potentially finance our community purchase?” Resident leaders should insist that, before hiring him or her, the consultant produce accounting spreadsheets showing how the deal would work. You have a right to know ‐ and need to understand ‐ this information. The consultant should be ready to explain the purchase financing for your community in detail. At the very least, the spreadsheets should include:‐‐ The price to be paid for the community (and an explanation of how the price was calculated);‐‐ Source(s), amounts, estimated interest rates and terms for mortgage financing;‐‐ Minimum number of residents who need to participate for the purchase to succeed;‐‐ Amount each household would pay as a down payment;‐‐ Any financing plans available for a resident’s down payment;‐‐ Total amount of equity required from the resident group;‐‐ Estimated new monthly “rent” (or member payment) for households that participate in the community purchase;‐‐ Estimated new monthly “rent” for those households that don’t participate in the community purchase;‐‐ Income and Expense schedule for community operations after the residents own it;‐‐ Amount of cash reserves the residents will have for repairs, emergencies, etc. after they own the community;‐‐ Closing costs for the transaction, including all fees or commissions to be paid."

El financiamiento normalmente tiene condiciones adicionales para garantizar que laasequibilidad continua de las viviendas en la comunidad y provee entrenamiento continuo,asistencia técnica, y orientación para la administración.Fideicomiso de TerrenoGeneralmente, el Fideicomiso de Terreno es un estado o una entidad local cual recibe fondos deprestamistas de desarrollo comunitario, proveedores de concesiones, fuentes de préstamos a bajointerés, el Departamento de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano de EE.UU., (HUD por sus siglas enIngles) municipios, etc. para adquirir bienes raíces para mantenerlos como viviendas asequibles.Muchos Fideicomisos de Terreno se enfocan en viviendas individuales por el cual losFideicomisos de Terreno adquieren el terreno y proveen un acuerdo de arrendamiento a largoplazo a las personas adquiriendo la vivienda localizada en ese terreno. Ellos típicamente seconcentran en personas con alcances de ingreso de muy bajo ingreso a ingreso moderado (usandolas pautas de ingreso medio de HUD). El resultado de dichos programas es para reducirmayormente el costo de ser propietario de casa. El Fideicomiso de Terreno normalmente incluyealgún tipo de información educativa de propietario de casa y entrenamiento, y frecuentemente, alvolverse a vender la casa por el dueño, comparte en la valorización del valor. La valorizaciónfrecuentemente se vuelve a invertir en la reventa de la casa para garantizar la asequibilidadcontinua de la propiedad.CaracterísticasCooperativa de patrimonio limitado:Los residentes de la comunidad siguen siendo los propietarios de sus casas, cuales no sonafectadas por el proceso de la compra.&nbsp;Los residentes participantes de la comunidad son dueños de una acción en la cooperativaa un costo nominal&nbsp;La cooperativa en si es propietaria de la comunidad&nbsp;El financiamiento para la cooperativa es de un consorcio de prestamistas de desarrollocomunitario y otras fuentes de préstamos a bajo interés&nbsp;Frecuentemente hay un Proveedor de Asistencia Técnica quien organiza a los residentesde la comunidad, coordina el financiamiento, y provee entrenamiento continuo yorientación de administración a la cooperativa.Fideicomiso de TerrenoLos métodos de compra de un Fideicomiso de Terreno comunitario son menosestandarizados que los métodos de Cooperativa de Patrimonio Limitado.&nbsp;El Fideicomiso de Terreno puede comprar la comunidad entera y manejarla de manerasimilar a un Proveedor de Viviendas Asequibles NFP&nbsp;El Fideicomiso de Terreno también puede comprar la comunidad en conjunción con losresidentes, en tal manera que los residentes son propietarios de propiedad dearrendamiento a largo plazo en la comunidad entera. (Esta porción de la transacción seríasimilar a una Cooperativa de Patrimonio Limitado.) Así que los residentes son lospropietarios y manejadores de un arrendamiento comunitario, mientras que elFideicomiso de Terreno es un inversionista relativamente pasivo recibiendo un pago dearrendamiento. Típicamente hay condiciones de viviendas asequibles (como restriccionesde reventa de la casa, ambos en las condiciones de precio y compradores elegibles)adscrito a la transacción.VentajasEl precio bajo de las acciones puede resultar en un membrecía con base amplia. Elaumento de precio de las acciones en el futuro es limitado.La disponibilidad de Asistencia Técnica le provee a los residentes con orientación delmanejo y la administración.Este método puede ser el mejor método para grupos de residentes de bajo ingreso.Este método provee un nivel relativamente alto de control por los residentes, perorequiere envolvimiento alto por los residentes, organización y responsabilidad.DesventajasAmbos un proceso de compra de LEC y un Fideicomiso de Terreno puede tomar untiempo largo debido a la complejidad de organizar a los residentes y la coordinacióncual se requiere para las fuentes de los fondos (suficientes fondos locales son muydifíciles de obtener). El propietario de la comunidad quizás no quiera esperar hastaque se hagan los arreglos para la transacción.Cada método requiere un gerente del proyecto (ya sea un Proveedor de AsistenciaTécnica o el personal del Fideicomiso de Terreno) para coordinar la transacción.Dichas organizaciones quizás no sean disponibles localmente, no tengan las destrezasespecíficas, o quizás no estén interesadas en envolverse con proyectos de comunidadde casas manufacturadas.Limitaciones sobre la reventa de las casas (cualquiera o ambos con referencia alprecio de la reventa de la casa o sea sobre compradores elegibles de bajo ingreso)pueden preocupar a los residentes y desanimarlos a que no hagan mejoras para lascasas.Quizás no sean disponibles suficientes fuentes de fondos de desarrollo de comunidad.Muy pocas (menos de 20) cooperativas existen en todo el oeste de los EstadosUnidos, entonces hay mucho que aprender sobre como adquirir las destrezas parautilizar este método en una manera exitosa.&nbsp;Método de compra – Corporación de Beneficio Mutuo&nbsp;¿QUE ES?Una Corporación de Beneficio Mutuo es una entidad establecida bajo la ley del estado como unacorporación sin fines de lucro (NFP por sus siglas en ingles) para el beneficio de sus miembros/accionistas. En caso de una comunidad de casas manufacturadas, los residentes en lacomunidad forman una corporación y esos residentes quienes elijan participar compranacciones/membrecías en la corporación. Los residentes quienes elijan no participar permanecencomo inquilinos con el mismo estatus legal cual tenían antes de la compra por los residentes.Con este método de compra, la corporación NFP es propietaria de la comunidad, y los residentesparticipantes, a su vez, son los propietarios de la corporación. Es similar pero no igual que unacooperativa, a cual también se le refiere como una Cooperativa de Patrimonio Limitado (LEC).Este método es considerado ""Tasa del Mercado” debido al hecho que la mayoría cuando notodos de los fondos para la compra son obtenidos de préstamos convencionales en vez depréstamos subvencionados (nivel de interés bajo) de fuentes tal como del gobierno estatal, local,proveedores de viviendas asequibles o proveedores de asistencia técnica. Este método esconsiderado una opción de compra razonable porque fondos de la Tasa del Mercado se puedenconseguir fácilmente. Los tipos de fondos típicos incluyen un préstamo de hipoteca primerahecho a la corporación de residentes, préstamos de acciones hechos a los residentes individualescuales necesitan ayuda para su acción en la corporación, y capital de los residentes quienespueden pagar por su acción en efectivo.CaracterísticasLos residentes de la comunidad siguen siendo los propietarios de sus casas, cuales no sonafectadas por el proceso de la compraNormalmente 60%-80% de los residentes participan como miembros, el resto de losresidentes continúan rentando el lote de casa de la corporaciónLos residente cuales participan están comprando su parte (acción) en la corporación y suderecho de ocupar su lote, de acuerdo a un acuerdo de arrendamiento de membrecía alargo plazoLos miembros eligen un Consejo Directivo de la corporación quienes supervisan elmanejo de la comunidadEl Consejo contrata a una compañía de administración para manejar las actividades dedía a díaLos miembros junto con el Consejo establecen las reglas de la comunidad y comofuncionaEl proceso de la compra es relativamente rápido (el proceso se puede tomar menos de 6meses para completarlo)Los fondos cuales se proveen tienen relativamente pocas restricciones. La corporación essujeta a ley estatal de empresas y cualesquiera reglamentos estatales para casasmanufacturadas apliquen a comunidades cuales son propiedad de inversionistas.En situaciones donde aplica el control de renta estatal o local, los miembros ya no sonsujetos a control de renta, mientras que los inquilinos que no participan son sujetos acontrol de renta.Es relativamente sencillo la transferencia de propietario de casa/acción a un residentenuevoVentajasAtrayente a los dueños de la comunidad porque el proceso procede rápidamenteNo se necesita que participe el 100% de los residentes para ser exitososNo hay limitaciones sobre precios de reventaLos fondos se pueden conseguir fácilmenteDesventajasSe requiere una inversión más grande por los residentes que otros métodosRequiere un alto nivel de envolvimiento, responsabilidad, y organización por parte de losresidentes cuales están participando.&nbsp;Resumen y CuestionesLas Corporaciones de Beneficio Mutuo se encuentran principalmente en la Costa Oeste y enFlorida. Hay muchas razones:Las comunidades de prestamistas son receptivas a este método,Falta de Proveedores de Asistencia Técnica para comunidades de casasmanufacturadas sufren limites de disponibilidad de otros métodosInterés por grupos de residentes en este método es más alto debido a la falta derestricciones en la reventa de las casas,Los antecedentes financieros y de vida de los residentes suelen causarles a gruposver a este método de compra como una alternativa atrayente,La ley estatal le permite y anima propiedad en Corporativa,Las fuentes de fondos subvencionados para otros métodos de compra son limitados o noexisten.&nbsp;Método de compra- subdivisión¿QUE ES?Hay varios nombres para este método de compra, tal como Subdivisión, Condo, HonorarioSimple o propiedad de Desarrollo de Unidad Planificada (PUD por sus siglas en ingles). Sinembargo, todas describen una situación donde la comunidad es dividida en lotes separados ycada lote se vende al residente individual cual ocupa ese lote en específico. Normalmente uninterés en un área común se vende con el lote. Típicamente hay tres maneras en cual unasubdivisión de una Comunidad de Casas Manufacturadas cual ya existe puede ocurrir:El propietario de la comunidad subdivide a la comunidad y vende los lotes individuales alos propietarios de casa,Los propietarios de casa, como un grupo, le plantean al dueño una proposición desubdividir y comprar la comunidad, o,Un intermediario (tal como una compañía privada o gobierno local) compra lacomunidad en coordinación con el grupo de residentes y entonces subdivide lacomunidad con ventas a los miembros individuales.CARACTERÍSTICASLos residentes de la comunidad continúan siendo los propietarios de sus casas,Los residentes de la comunidad son dueños de su tierra (o derechos de ‘condo air space’)debajo de sus casas,Todos los residentes participando juntos son los propietarios de las áreas comunes de lacomunidad y infraestructuras, normalmente a través de una asociación de propietarios decasa.VENTAJASAlgunos residentes consideraron este método de compra como atrayente porque es“cumplir el Sueño Americano” de ser propietario de vivienda.Dueños de lotes individuales tienen envolvimiento limitado con sus vecinos y no sepreocupan si su vecino tiene dificultades financieras (económicas) y preocupaciónlimitada si la comunidad tiene problemas.Aunque la asociación de propietarios tiene un Consejo Directivo para administrar lasáreas comunes y la infraestructura, dicho Consejo tiene control limitado sobre los dueñosde lote, y la conducta dentro de la subdivisión es gobernada por sus Clausulas,Condiciones y Restricciones (también llamadas CCyRs por sus siglas en ingles)documentadas cuando la subdivisión es formada.DESVENTAJASLos residentes individuales tiene que poder pagar para comprar (o para financiar, siapropiado) su lote, basado en su crédito personal y su ingresoPuede ser difícil lograr los fondos para la compra del lote. Prestamistas interesadas enfinanciar pueden requerir que la casa sea colocada en una fundación permanenteLos lotes en una Subdivisión pueden ser sujetos a impuestos de propiedad más altos.Municipios locales cuales tienen jurisdicción sobre la subdivisión pueden requerirmejoramientos para el agua, alcantarillo, calles y sistemas de agua de tormenta,resultando en valoraciones individuales en cada lote para pagar por dichosmejoramientos.La finalización actual del proceso de la subdivisión puede tomarse un tiempoconsiderable (a veces años antes de que el lote final se venda) en cuanto cada residenteintenta calificar para la compra de su loteAlgunos residentes se siente forzados a mudarse de la comunidad debido a que no puedenpagar por la compra de su lote y la casa/lote en si está en demanda de residentes nuevosposibles.Muchas casas en las comunidades son casas más viejas (pre-1976) y dichas casasfrecuentemente no califican como garantía para financiamiento. Consecuentemente,aunque un propietario quizás crea que hay capital considerable en la casa dicho capital noestá disponible para facilitar el financiamiento del lote.Algunos propietarios, (en particular en California) están usando el proceso de lassubdivisiones como un pretexto para forzar a los residentes de las restricciones locales decontrol de renta, resultando en rentas de lote más altas para esos residentes quienes nopueden comprar sus lotesEl proceso de evaluar los lotes individuales puede ser complicado y pueda aparecerinjusto – ¿Vale lo mismo un lote doble amplio en la esquina con vista panorámica que unlote interior de amplio sencillo?Cualquier deuda en la comunidad típicamente se tiene que liquidar (frecuentemente conrecargo de prepago) antes de la compra siendo que la mayoría de préstamos NO permitenla cesión de lotes individuales.El usar un intermediario financiero puede ser muy caro, debido a que el intermediarioestá comprando la comunidad del dueño, normalmente a un “precio de mercado”, ydespués agregándole los costos del intermediario y aumento para determinar el precio dellote.&nbsp;Resumen y Cuestiones (problemas)&nbsp;Las subdivisiones se encuentran principalmente en Florida, posiblemente debido al índole de altoingreso de los grupos de residentes en ese estado y la disponibilidad del financiamiento para lacompra de los lotes por prestamistas locales. Información sobre otros estados es difícil deobtener. Hay algunas comunidades construidas como subdivisiones en Texas. Californiaposiblemente tiene 20 o más, la mayoría formadas a fines de los 1980’s y a principios de los1990’s cuando financiamiento apropiado era más fácil de obtener.Este método (afuera de Florida) de convertir una comunidad de casas manufacturadas cual yaexiste a propiedad de los residentes puede tener una alta probabilidad para el fracaso. No puedencalificar suficientes residentes para el financiamiento, y las cantidades y fuentes definanciamiento muy seguido no son disponibles para asegurar el éxito.Estas son algunas preguntas importantes cuales debería de preguntar a cualquier asesor quequiera ayudar con su compra de comunidad de residente. No acepte respuestas imprecisas oincompletas a estas preguntas:¿Cuanto tiempo tiene de ser un asesor de compras a los grupos de residentes decomunidades de casas manufacturadas?¿A cuantas comunidades les ha ayudado usted en convertir a residentes propietarios?¿Al final de la transacción, quien era el propietario de estas comunidades? Los residenteseran los dueños en si o los dueños eran una corporación de fuera.¿Dónde están estas comunidades? Por favor nómbrelas, para que nosotros podamosponernos en contacto con los residentes para saber como resultaron las cosas.¿Cuándo se completo su compra más reciente de una comunidad? (Tratos cuales el asesorestá tratando de completar a este momento no cuentan). Describa generalmente como selogro el financiamiento hipotecario para esa transacción. (Si el asesor no ha completadoun trato recientemente, quizás tengan problemas en tramitar un préstamo hipotecario enel mercado actual).Ensénenos lo específico de cómo nuestra compra de la comunidad sería financiada.¿Cuanto se tendrá que conseguir en préstamo? ¿De donde vendrá el dinero? ¿Vendrá defuentes privadas o publicas? ¿Cuanto dinero vendría de cada fuente? ¿Ha tramitadoexitosamente préstamos hipotecarios de estas fuentes antes? Denos algunos ejemplosespecíficos.“¿Nos puede proveer con cartas de “Expresiones de Interés” de los prestamistaspotenciales quienes financiarían nuestra compra de comunidad?”. Los líderes de losresidentes deben insistir que el asesor, antes de contratarlo, produzca hojas de cálculo decontabilidad mostrando como funcionaria el trato. Usted tiene el derecho de saber –necesita entender – esta información. El asesor debe estar preparado para explicar elfinanciamiento de compra para su comunidad en detalle. Las hojas de cálculo deben deincluir por lo menos:El precio que se pagará por la comunidad, (y una explicación de cómo se calculóel precioFuente (s), cantidades, estima de tasa de interés y las condiciones para elfinanciamiento hipotecario;El número mínimo de residentes quienes necesitan participar para que la comprasea un éxito;La cantidad que cada hogar tendrá que pagar como engancheHay algunos planes de financiamiento disponible para el enganche del residente;La cantidad total de capital cual será requerida del grupo de residentesPresupuesto de pago mensual nuevo para la “renta” (o pago del miembro) parahogares que participan en la compra de la comunidadPresupuesto de pago mensual nuevo para la “renta” para esos hogares que noparticipan en la compra de la comunidad;Lista de Ingreso y Gastos para el manejo de la comunidad después que losresidentes sean los propietariosCantidad de reservas de dinero en efectivo que los residentes tendrán para lasreparaciones, emergencias, etc. después que ellos sean los propietarios de lacomunidadLos costos de cierre para la transacción, incluyendo todos los honorarios ocomisiones que se tendrán que pagar."

Federal Fair Housing Act
Predatory Lending",,Housing,"Discrimination in mortgage lending is prohibited by the Fair Housing Act.&nbsp; The Act makes it unlawful to engage in discriminatory practices based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap (disability).&nbsp; Examples of discrimination in lending include:Refusing to make a mortgage loanRefusing to provide information regarding loansImposing different terms or conditions on a loan, such as different interest rates, points, or feesDiscriminating in appraising propertyRefusing to purchase a loan or setting different terms or conditions for purchasing a loanPre-Application DiscriminationPrior to applying for a loan, many consumers contact lenders to inquire about mortgage lending and financing options available to them.&nbsp; The information they receive at this stage, may determine whether they decide to enter the home buying market or will determine the parameters of their housing search.&nbsp; Therefore, it is crucial that potential homebuyers obtain full and fair access to information about mortgage financing.To determine whether minority homebuyers receive the same treatment and information as whites at the pre-application phase of the loan process, the Urban Institute, under contract with HUD, conducted a study using the paired testing technique. In the paired tests, two individuals of different races who were equally qualified in every way were matched together. Posing as homebuyers, the two then inquired about the availability and terms for home mortgage loans. The pilot test results have shown that in both Los Angeles and Chicago, African American and Hispanic homebuyers face a significant risk of receiving less favorable treatment than equally qualified whites when inquiring about mortgage financing.Subprime LendingSubprime loans are intended to make homeownership possible for many families who have blemished credit histories or who otherwise fail to qualify for prime, conventional loans. Data shows that blacks are much more likely than whites to get a subprime loan, and many of the borrowers who take out these loans could qualify for loans with better rates and terms.&nbsp; In one government study, in African American neighborhoods, 51% of the refinanced mortgages were subprime; compared to only 9% in predominantly white neighborhoods. &nbsp;Because of this troubling data, subprime loans can raise fair lending concerns.&nbsp; It is important, if you are offered a subprime loan, to shop around and make sure you are getting the most favorable loan terms possible for your situation.&nbsp; If you are offered a subprime loan even though your credit history qualifies you for better terms and you have reason to believe that discrimination was a factor, you can contact HUD to file a fair housing complaint.Predatory LendingSome lenders, often referred to as predatory lenders, saddle borrowers with loans that come with outrageous terms and conditions, often through deception. Elderly women and minorities frequently report that they have been targeted, or preyed upon, by these lenders. The typical predatory loan is: (1) in excess of those available to similarly situated borrowers from other lenders elsewhere in the lending market, (2) not justified by the creditworthiness of the borrower or the risk of loss, and (3) secured by the borrower's home.Examples of predatory lending:Excessive fees – A predatory mortgage has high and hidden loan fees, often in excess of 5% of the of the total loan amount.&nbsp;Selling properties for much more than they are worth using false appraisals.Encouraging borrowers to lie about their income, expenses, or cash available for down payments in order to get a loan.Knowingly lending more money than a borrower can afford to repay.Charging high interest rates to borrowers based on their race or national origin and not on their credit history.Charging fees for unnecessary or nonexistent products and services – examples of types of products a lender may try to pressure a consumer to add on: fire and hazard insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and insurance where premiums are paid in advance.Pressuring borrowers to accept higher-risk loans such as:&nbsp;Balloon loansInterest only paymentsSteep pre-payment penalties – can keep a borrower trapped in a bad loan with no ability to refinanceTargeting vulnerable borrowers to cash-out refinance offers when they know borrowers are in need of cash due to medical, unemployment or debt problems.""Stripping"" homeowners' equity from their homes by convincing them to refinance again and again when there is no benefit to the borrower.Mandatory arbitration – makes it illegal for the homeowner to take legal action against their lender; only right the borrower has is to take their grievances to arbitration.Tips for Consumers:Get information about the prices of other homes in the neighborhood. Don't be fooled into paying too much.Shop for a lender and compare costs. Be suspicious if anyone tries to steer you to just one lender.Do NOT let anyone persuade you to make a false statement on your loan application, such as overstating your income, the source of your down payment, failing to disclose the nature and amount of your debts, or even how long you have been employed. When you apply for a mortgage loan, every piece of information that you submit must be accurate and complete. Lying on a mortgage application is fraud and may result in criminal penalties.Do NOT let anyone convince you to borrow more money than you know you can afford to repay. If you get behind on your payments, you risk losing your house and all of the money you put into your property.Never sign a blank document or a document containing blanks. If information is inserted by someone else after you have signed, you may still be bound to the terms of the contract. Insert ""N/A"" (i.e., not applicable) or cross through any blanks.Read everything carefully and ask questions. Do not sign anything that you don't understand.Filing a ComplaintIf you have experienced lending discrimination, you can visit HUD’s housing discrimination complaint website to file a complaint or learn more about the complaint process.&nbsp;The work that provided the basis for this publication was supported by funding under a grant with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is FHA's reverse mortgage program which enables you to withdraw some of the equity in your home. The HECM is a safe plan that can give older Americans greater financial security. Many seniors use it to supplement social security, meet unexpected medical expenses, make home improvements and more.

Predatory Lending: What is it? Predatory lending is the practice of preying on, or taking advantage of, an individual or group of people that may have a difficult time buying or refinancing a home such as people who may be poor, uneducated, elderly or in the protected classes (race, religion, national origin, color, disability, familial status, gender). &nbsp;What is the issue? Certain groups of people are denied their dream of owning a home.These same groups are forced to accept lending that is subprime. Homeowners are at risk of losing their homes or financial security. Predatory Lending: Who is at risk? Low-income familiesMinoritiesSeniorsPersons with disabilities What is a prime loan? “In conventional lending [prime loans], you're dealing with borrowers with high credit scores, solid income and single-family residences --&nbsp; basic [well qualified] borrowers…” What is a Sub-prime loan? “…in subprime, you're dealing with people who can't prove any income, have low [credit] scores, have had bankruptcies, have way too much credit or need higher loan to values on their property.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Charlie Cartwright, LenderBase Corp. Consider that subprime lenders grade customers the same way that elementary school teachers grade children. Depending on an applicant's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, ability to verify income and other variables, a lender or broker assesses a letter grade that typically ranges from ""A+"" down to ""D."" The loan officer then charges a rate appropriate to that category. Because the distinctions between categories are often slight, borrowers can move up the scale without much effort. For example, lenders tend to grade people based on how many times they were 30 or 60 days late with their mortgage payments in the past year. Having two ""30-day lates"" might push them into the ""A-"" category while having just one would keep them in the ""A"" zone. As a result, a customer who was late twice, but one of the late payments was 11 months ago, can improve a notch by just waiting a few extra days to borrow. By doing so, that customer could save a half a percentage point, or 50 basis points, on the interest rate, according to pricing sheets wholesale lenders send to mortgage brokers. So…Sub-prime loans… provide credit to persons with past credit problems, insufficient credit history, previous bankruptcy, spotty employment, and others that do not meet credit standards in the prime (conventional) loan market. Subprime Loans and Minorities: In five years increased by 10 percent.Three times more likely in a low-income neighborhood than in high-income.Five times more likely in black neighborhoods than in white.Two times more likely in high-income black neighborhoods than in low-income white . From 1993 to 1998, the # of subprime refinancing loans increased ten-fold. Subprime loans are three times more likely in low income neighborhoods than in high-income neighborhoods. Subprime loans are five times more likely in black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods. Racial disparity is so great that homeowners in high-income black areas are twice as likely as homeowners in low-income white areas to have subprime loans. –HUD No. 00-75 Subprime loans and Seniors: Seniors become targets because: “cash-poor” even though “asset-rich”Limited financial resources (income)Limited knowledge about financing alternativesLarge or unexpected bills for medical expenses or repairs on their older homes Predatory Lending: Who does it?&nbsp; (Not an exclusive list.) AppraisersMortgage brokers/bankersHome improvement contractorsLenders/BankersReal estate agentsSavings and loansCredit unions Predatory lenders:&nbsp; What do they do?&nbsp; (Not an exclusive list.) False appraisals.Encourage false information. Lend more than can be repaid.Charge more interest based on race or national origin.Charge for unneeded products and services.Pressure borrowers to accept higher-risk loans.Target vulnerable borrowers.Refinance again and again (called “flipping”).Pressure to refinance and charge high interest rates.Encourage borrowers to sign blank forms. &nbsp; Sell properties for more than they are worth using false appraisals.Encourage borrowers to lie about their income, expenses, or cash available for down payments in order to get a loan.Knowingly lend more money than a borrower can afford to repay.Charge high interest rates to borrowers based on their race or national origin and not on their credit history.Charge fees for unnecessary or nonexistent products and services.Pressure borrowers to accept higher-risk loans such as balloon loans, interest only payments, and steep pre-payment penalties.Target vulnerable borrowers to cash-out refinances offers when they know borrowers are in need of cash due to medical, unemployment or debt problems.Strip homeowners’ equity from their homes by convincing them to refinance again and again when there is no benefit to the borrower.Use high-pressure sales tactics to sell home improvements and then finance them at high interest rates. More Abusive Practices…&nbsp; (Not an exclusive list.) Single premium credit insurance.High fees.Prepayment penalties.Yield-spread premiums.Steering.Mandatory arbitration.Flipping.Balloon payments.Interest only loans.Higher interest rates.Debt shifting.Recommend subprime loans. (For more information see www.responsiblelending.org) 1. Credit insurance premiums should not be financed into the loan up-front in a lump-sum payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Borrower should not be charged excessive points and fees for conventional, FHA or VA loans.&nbsp; Please check with your Department of Finance or HUD if you have questions or a suspicion that you are being charged excessive points. 3. Loans should not include prepayment penalties because prepayment penalties trap borrowers in high-rate loans, which too often leads to foreclosure, and prepayment penalties are hidden, deferred fees that strip significant equity. 4. Fees that lenders rebate to brokers in exchange for placing a borrower in a higher interest rate than the borrower qualifies for. Brokers originate over half of all mortgage loans and a small number of brokers are responsible for a large percentage of predatory loans. 5. Lenders should make sure that borrowers get the lowest-cost loan they qualify for. 6. Lenders should not allow clauses in the loan contracts that force the borrower into arbitration in the event of a dispute for wrongful practices. 7. Flipping of borrowers occurs through repeated fee-loaded refinancing. Lenders refinance subprime loans over and over, taking out home equity wealth in the form of high fees each time without providing the borrower with a net tangible benefit. 8. Balloon payments are a condition of a loan when a very large payment comes due a few years into the loan. 9. Interest only payments are loans where the borrower’s payments only cover the interest portion of the loan and not principle. 10. Debt shifting is when unsecured debt is shifted into a secured mortgage. 11. When lenders recommend subprime loans for people who qualify for conventional loans. What tactics do predators use?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “This is your only chance”.“The Federal Housing Administration insurance protects you against property defects or loan fraud”.“Refinancing can solve your credit or money problems”.“You can only get a good deal on a home improvement loan if you finance with this lender”. 1. A lender or investor tells you that they are your only chance of getting a loan or owning a home. You should be able to take your time to shop around and compare prices and houses. 2. You are told that the Federal Housing Administration insurance protects you against property defects or loan fraud – it does not. 3. You are told that refinancing can solve your credit or money problems. 4. You are told that you can only get a good deal on a home improvement if you finance it with a particular lender. Possible signs of lending abuses: House costs more than similar ones in the neighborhood.Sales contract or loan document has blanks or false information.Cost or closing terms are different. 1. The house you are buying costs a lot more than other homes in the neighborhood, but isn’t any bigger or better. 2. You are asked to sign a sales contract or loan documents that are blank or that contain information which is not true. 3. The cost or loan terms at closing are not what you agreed to. Protect Yourself: be a smart consumer Educate yourself about homeownership.Interview real estate professionals.Find out about the prices of comparable homes. Have the property inspected.Shop for a lender.Read everything carefully and ask questions.Watch that the cost doesn’t increase.Don’t be persuaded to make false statements.Don’t be persuaded to borrow more than you can repay.Don’t sign a blank document or a document containing blanks.Don’t make false statements about your intention to occupy. 12 Tips On Being A Smart Consumer 1. Before you buy a home, attend a homeownership education course offered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved, non-profit counseling agencies. 2. Interview several real estate professionals (agents), and ask for and check references before you select one to help you buy or sell a home. 3. Get information about the prices of other homes in the neighborhood. Don't be fooled into paying too much. 4. Hire a properly qualified and licensed home inspector to carefully inspect the property before you are obligated to buy. Determine whether you or the seller is going to be responsible for paying for the repairs. If you have to pay for the repairs, determine whether or not you can afford to make them. 5. Shop for a lender and compare costs. Be suspicious if anyone tries to steer you to just one lender. 6. Read everything carefully and ask questions. Do not sign anything that you don't understand. Before signing, have your contract and loan agreement reviewed by an attorney skilled in real estate law, consult with a trusted real estate professional or ask for help from a housing counselor with a HUD-approved agency. If you cannot afford an attorney, take your documents to the HUD-approved housing counseling agency near you to find out if they will review the documents or can refer you to an attorney who will help you for free or at low cost. 7. Be suspicious when the cost of a home improvement goes up if you don't accept the contractor's financing. 8. Do NOT let anyone persuade you to make a false statement on your loan application, such as overstating your income, the source of your down payment, failing to disclose the nature and amount of your debts, or even how long you have been employed. When you apply for a mortgage loan, every piece of information that you submit must be accurate and complete. Lying on a mortgage application is fraud and may result in criminal penalties. 9. Do NOT let anyone convince you to borrow more money than you know you can afford to repay. If you get behind on your payments, you risk losing your house and all of the money you put into your property. 10. Never sign a blank document or a document containing blanks. If information is inserted into the loan document by someone else after you have signed, you may still be bound to the terms of the contract. Insert ""N/A"" (i.e., not applicable) or cross through any blanks. 11. Be honest about your intention to occupy the house. Stating that you plan to live there when, in fact, you are not (because you intend to rent the house to someone else or fix it up and resell it) violates federal law and is a crime. 12. Make sure that your mortgage payment is no more than 30% of your net income.&nbsp; Make sure you include all of your expenses in determining the 30%. What can you do?

Predatory Lending",Housing," Before you buy a home, attend a home ownership education course offered by the United States  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved, non-profit counseling agencies.  Interview several real estate professionals (agents), and ask for and check references before you  select one to help you buy or sell a home.  Get information about the prices of other homes in the neighborhood. Do not be fooled into  paying too much.  Hire a properly qualified and licensed home inspector to carefully inspect the property before you are  obligated to buy. Determine whether you or the seller is going to be responsible for paying for the repairs. If you have to pay for the repairs, determine whether or not you can afford to make them.  Shop for a lender and compare costs. Be suspicious if anyone tries to steer you to just one lender.  Read everything carefully and ask questions. Do not sign anything that you don't understand. Before signing, have your contract and loan agreement reviewed by an attorney skilled in real estate law, consult with a trusted real estate professional or ask for help from a housing counselor with a HUD-approved agency. If you cannot afford an attorney, take your documents to the HUD-approved housing counseling agency near you to find out if they will review the documents or can refer you to an attorney who will help you for free or at low cost.  Be suspicious when the cost of a home improvement goes up if you do not accept the contractor's financing.  Do NOT let anyone persuade you to make a false statement on your loan application, such as overstating your income, the source of your down payment, failing to disclose the nature and amount of your debts, or even how long you have been employed. When you apply for a mortgage loan, every piece of information that you submit must be accurate and complete. Lying on a mortgage application is fraud and may result in criminal penalties.  Do NOT let anyone convince you to borrow more money than you know you can afford to repay. If you get behind on your payments, you risk losing your house and all of the money you put into your property.  Never sign a blank document or a document containing blanks. If information is inserted into the loan document by someone else after you have signed, you may still be bound to the terms of the contract. Insert ""N/A""(i.e., not applicable) or cross through any blanks.  Be honest about your intention to occupy the house. Stating that you plan to live there when, in fact, you are not (because you intend to rent the house to someone else or fix it up and resell it) violates federal law and is a crime.  Make sure that your mortgage payment is no more than 30% of your net income.  Make sure you include all of your expenses in determining the 30%. "

U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill says Idaho must do more to ensure  recipients or their guardians are properly notified of the changes.

The Department of Health and Welfare says the agency is working on a plan to ensure those affected by cuts get adequate notice.

With  today’s settlement, the federal government will ensure that the more  than 200,000 African-American and Hispanic borrowers who were  discriminated against by Countrywide will be entitled to compensation.”The  settlement resolves the United States’ pricing and steering claims  against Countrywide for its discrimination against African Americans and  Hispanics.&nbsp;The  United States’ complaint alleges that African-American and Hispanic  borrowers paid more than non-Hispanic white borrowers, not based on  borrower risk, but because of their race or national origin.&nbsp;  Countrywide’s business practice allowed its loan officers and mortgage  brokers to vary a loan’s interest rate and other fees from the price it  set based on the borrower’s objective credit-related factors.&nbsp; This  subjective and unguided pricing discretion resulted in African American  and Hispanic borrowers paying more.&nbsp; The complaint further alleges that  Countrywide was aware the fees and interest rates it was charging  discriminated against African-American and Hispanic borrowers, but  failed to impose meaningful limits or guidelines to stop it.&nbsp;“Countrywide’s  actions contributed to the housing crisis, hurt entire communities, and  denied families access to the American dream,” said Thomas E. Perez,  Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.&nbsp; “We are using  every tool in our law enforcement arsenal, including some that were  dormant for years, to go after institutions of all sizes that  discriminated against families solely because of their race or national  origin.”The  United States’ complaint also alleges that, as a result of  Countrywide’s policies and practices, qualified African-American and  Hispanic borrowers were placed in subprime loans rather than prime loans  even when similarly-qualified non-Hispanic white borrowers were placed  in prime loans.&nbsp; The discriminatory placement of borrowers in subprime  loans, also known as “steering,” occurred because it was Countrywide’s  business practice to allow mortgage brokers and employees to place a  loan applicant in a subprime loan even when the applicant qualified for a  prime loan.&nbsp; In addition, Countrywide gave mortgage brokers discretion  to request exceptions to the underwriting guidelines, and Countrywide’s  employees had discretion to grant these exceptions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  is the first time that the Justice Department has alleged and obtained  relief for borrowers who were steered into loans based on race or  national origin, a practice that systematically placed borrowers of  color into subprime mortgage loan products while placing non-Hispanic  white borrowers with similar creditworthiness in prime loans.&nbsp; By  steering borrowers into subprime loans from 2004 to 2007, the complaint  alleges, Countrywide harmed those qualified African-American and  Hispanic borrowers.&nbsp; Subprime loans generally carried higher-cost terms,  such as prepayment penalties and exploding adjustable interest rates  that increased suddenly after two or three years, making the payments  unaffordable and leaving the borrowers at a much higher risk of  foreclosure.The  settlement also resolves the department’s claim that Countrywide  violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by discriminating on the basis  of marital status against non-applicant spouses of borrowers by  encouraging them to sign away their home ownership rights.&nbsp; The law  allows married individuals to apply for credit either in their own name  or jointly with their spouse, even when the property is owned by both  spouses.&nbsp; For applications made by married individuals applying solely  in their own name between 2004 and 2008, Countrywide encouraged  non-applicant spouses to sign quitclaim deeds or other documents  transferring their legal rights and interests in jointly-held property  to the borrowing spouse.&nbsp; Non-applicant spouses who execute a quitclaim  deed risk substantial uncertainty and financial loss by losing all their  rights and interests in the property securing the loan.&nbsp;In  addition, the settlement requires Countrywide to implement policies and  practices to prevent discrimination if it returns to the lending  business during the next four years.&nbsp; Countrywide currently operates as a  subsidiary of Bank of America but does not originate new loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The  department’s investigation into Countrywide’s lending practices began  after referrals by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the  Office of Thrift Supervision to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights  Division in 2007 and 2008 for potential patterns or practices of  discrimination by Countrywide.Today’s  announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama’s Financial  Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF). President Obama established the  interagency FFETF to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive  effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The task force  includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies,  regulatory authorities, inspectors general and state and local law  enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of  criminal and civil enforcement resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; The task force is working to  improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and  local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial  crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate  financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial  markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For  more information on the task force, visit www.StopFraud.gov.A  copy of the complaint and proposed settlement order, as well as  additional information about fair lending enforcement by the Justice  Department, can be obtained from the Justice Department website at www.justice.gov/fairhousing.&nbsp;The  proposed settlement provides for an independent administrator to  contact and distribute payments of compensation at no cost to borrowers  whom the Justice Department identifies as victims of Countrywide’s  discrimination.&nbsp; The department will make a public announcement and post  contact information on its website once an administrator is chosen.&nbsp;  Borrowers who are eligible for compensation from the settlement will  then be contacted by the administrator.&nbsp; Individuals who believe that  they may have been victims of lending discrimination by Countrywide and  have questions about the settlement may&nbsp;email&nbsp;the department at countrywide.settlement@usdoj.gov."

Idaho Borrowers to Net Nearly $100 Million Benefit from Settlement with 5 Largest Mortgage Servicers

(Boise) - Attorney General Lawrence Wasden today joined a $25 billion state-federal settlement with the nation’s five largest mortgage servicers.&nbsp; The settlement resolves state and federal claims relating to mortgage origination, servicing, and foreclosure practices of Bank of America, Citi, J.P. Morgan Chase, Ally, and Wells Fargo.&nbsp; Collectively, these companies service approximately half of the U.S. mortgage loan market.

The settlement preserves the ability of governments to pursue civil or criminal legal remedies on other issues related to the financial and housing crises.&nbsp; It also preserves the rights of individual borrowers and investors to pursue individual, institutional or class action cases against the banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The agreement provides an estimated $99,857,551 in direct relief to Idaho homeowners whose mortgages are owned and serviced by any of the five settling banks and to individuals whose mortgages were serviced by one of the settling banks and who lost their homes in foreclosures.&nbsp; It also creates loan servicing standards that the settling banks must follow.

Idaho’s estimated share of the settlement is $113,789,551.&nbsp; From that total:


	Eligible Idaho borrowers will receive an estimated $74,686,493 in benefits from loan modifications and other direct relief.
	Approximately 5,000 Idaho borrowers who lost their home to foreclosure between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2011, because of substandard servicing practices, will receive $9,998,041 in cash payments averaging $1500 to $2,000 for each affected borrower. These borrowers have been identified by their servicers and will be contacted by the settlement administrator.
	The settling servicers will pay $15,172,779 to fund a program that allows underwater borrowers to refinance their loans.
	The state will receive $13,932,238.


“The settlement holds the participating banks accountable for their unacceptable mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices and provides relief to homeowners,” Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said. “Backed by a federal court order, the settlement will aid homeowners with enforceable changes to how their loans are serviced.”

The settlement is the result of an 18-month multistate law enforcement investigation of the participating banks’ servicing practices. The investigation began in response to allegations that the banks were filing fraudulent documents with the courts in judicial foreclosure cases.&nbsp; A judicial foreclosure is one that is conducted under the supervision of a court.&nbsp; While Idaho allows for judicial foreclosures, it is not widely used here.&nbsp; In Idaho, foreclosure is most often done by “advertisement and sale.”&nbsp; In such foreclosures, the lender does not file documents in court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, the lender or servicer notifies the borrower of the default and the lender’s decision to sell the property at a trustee’s sale.

The investigation expanded beyond issues of so-called document “robo-signing” and focused also on allegations that the banks may have:


	failed to timely and accurately apply borrowers’ loan payments;
	charged excessive or improper fees for default-related services;
	failed to properly oversee third-parties involved in the banks’ servicing activities;
	imposed high-cost hazard insurance on borrowers without properly notifying them;
	provided false or misleading information in response to borrowers’ complaints; and
	failed to maintain appropriate staffing, training and quality control systems.


The settlement provides for comprehensive new servicing and foreclosure protections for borrowers, including:


	an end to robo-signing;
	timely and accurate application of borrowers’ payments;
	proper oversight of third-parties (e.g., attorneys, trustee companies, etc.) that participate in servicing or foreclosure activities;
	adequate staffing and systems to track loan modification documents;
	notice of delinquency to the borrower 14 days before the loan is referred to foreclosure;
	notice to the borrower of all loss mitigation options before the loan is referred to foreclosure;
	restrictions on simultaneous loan modification reviews and foreclosure actions (i.e., dual-track);
	a single point of contact for each borrower who contacts the bank about a loan modification;
	a decision on loan modification applications within 30 days of receipt;
	enhanced protections for individuals serving in the military;
	an independent internal review of all loan modification denials;
	development of a short sale process that allows borrowers to obtain a short sale evaluation before putting the home on the market; and
	proper documentation of the banks’ authority to foreclose.


“The agreement does not prevent homeowners or investors from pursuing individual, institutional or class action civil cases against the five banks, nor does it prevent state attorneys general and federal agencies from pursuing other aspects of the mortgage crisis, including securities cases,” Wasden said. “Further, the settlement does not grant the banks immunity from criminal prosecution.”
Wasden noted that a federal task force formed last month will investigate those responsible for misconduct contributing to the financial crisis through the pooling and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities.

The final agreement will be filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., and, following approval of the court, will have the authority of a court order.

Because of the complexity of the mortgage market and this agreement, which will span a three-year period, in some cases participating mortgage servicers will contact borrowers directly regarding loan modification options. However, Idahoans with loans serviced by the five participating banks should contact the bank directly to obtain more information about specific loan modification programs and requirements. The national settlement administrator may also contact borrowers regarding certain aspects of the settlement.

Information about this settlement and other mortgage-related subjects will be available on the Attorney General’s website.

In addition, a website dedicated to this settlement has been created at&nbsp; www.NationalForeclosureSettlement.com.

BoA has continued to maximize the value of its mortgage portfolio with anti-HAMP modification practices and managed to make money by committing fraud on homeowner,"" the lawsuit said.A lawyer for Mackler could neither confirm nor deny that the complaint was tied to the settlement. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office and a representative for Bank of America declined to comment.In February, a whistleblower complaint was unsealed from Kyle Lagow, a former employee in a Countrywide appraisal unit which detailed allegations of Countrywide's ""corrupt underwriting and appraisal process."" Bank of America purchased Countywide in June 2008.Under the False Claims Act, successful whistleblower complaints can earn that whistleblower up to 25 percent of the settlement amount.According to the docket, the U.S. Department of Justice has until March 16 to decide whether to intervene in both the Mackler and Lagow case. The case is United States of America v. Bank of America NA et al., in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, no. 11-3270.####&nbsp;The complaint is available at http://www.scribd.com/doc/84503965/V-Bank-of-America-NA?olddoc=1.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

761,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2325,Justice Department Reaches Settlement with Wells Fargo Resulting in More Than $175 Million in Relief for Homeowners to Resolve Fair Lending Claims,,,Housing,"Department of JusticeOffice of Public AffairsThursday, July 12, 2012The Department of Justice today filed the second largest fair lending settlement in the department’s history to resolve allegations that Wells Fargo Bank, the largest residential home mortgage originator in the United States, engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its mortgage lending from 2004 through 2009.&nbsp;Wells Fargo will also provide $50 million in direct down payment assistance to borrowers in communities around the country where the department identified large numbers of discrimination victims and which were hard hit by the housing crisis. &nbsp;Additionally, Wells Fargo has agreed to conduct an internal review of its retail mortgage lending and will compensate African-American and Hispanic retail borrowers who were placed into subprime loans when similarly qualified white retail borrowers received prime loans. &nbsp; Compensation paid to any retail borrowers identified in the review process will be in addition to the $125 million to compensate wholesale borrowers who were victims of discrimination .“The department’s action makes clear that we will hold financial institutions accountable, including some of the nation’s largest, for lending discrimination,” said Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole. “An applicant’s creditworthiness, and not the color of his or her skin, should determine what loans a borrower qualifies for. With today’s settlement, the federal government will ensure that African-American and Hispanic borrowers who were discriminated against will be entitled to compensation and borrowers in communities hit hard by this housing crisis will have an opportunity to access homeownership.”The settlement, which is subject to court approval, was filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in conjunction with the department’s complaint, which alleges that between 2004 and 2008, Wells Fargo discriminated by steering approximately 4,000 African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers, as well as additional retail borrowers, into subprime mortgages when non-Hispanic white borrowers with similar credit profiles received prime loans. &nbsp; All the borrowers who were allegedly discriminated against were qualified for Wells Fargo mortgage loans according to Well Fargo’s own underwriting criteria.The United States also alleges that, between 2004 and 2009, Wells Fargo discriminated by charging approximately 30,000 African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers higher fees and rates than non-Hispanic white borrowers because of their race or national origin rather than the borrowers’ credit worthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk. &nbsp;“By reaching a settlement in this case, African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers who received subprime loans when they should have received prime loans or who paid more for their loans will get swift and meaningful relief,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. &nbsp; “As one of the largest mortgage lenders in the country, Wells Fargo’s commitment to conduct an internal review of its retail lending and compensate African American and Hispanic retail borrowers who may have been improperly placed in subprime loans is significant. We will continue to work aggressively to ensure that all qualified borrowers have access to credit on an equal basis.”The United States’ complaint alleges that African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers paid more than non-Hispanic white wholesale borrowers, not based on borrower risk, but because of their race or national origin. &nbsp; Wells Fargo’s business practice allowed its loan officers and mortgage brokers to vary a loan’s interest rate and other fees from the price it set based on the borrower’s objective credit-related factors . &nbsp; This subjective and unguided pricing discretion resulted in African-American and Hispanic borrowers paying more. &nbsp; The complaint alleges that Wells Fargo was aware the fees and interest rates it was charging discriminated against African-American and Hispanic borrowers, but the actions it took were insufficient and ineffective in stopping it. &nbsp;The United States’ complaint also alleges that, as a result of Wells Fargo’s policies and practices, qualified African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers were placed in subprime loans rather than prime loans even when similarly-qualified non-Hispanic white borrowers were placed in prime loans. &nbsp; The discriminatory placement of wholesale borrowers in subprime loans, also known as “steering,” occurred because it was the bank’s business practice to allow mortgage brokers and employees to place a loan applicant in a subprime loan even when the applicant qualified for a prime loan . &nbsp; In addition, Wells Fargo gave mortgage brokers discretion to request exceptions to the underwriting guidelines, and Wells Fargo’s employees had discretion to grant these exceptions. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time that the Justice Department has alleged and obtained relief for borrowers who were steered into loans based on race or national origin, a practice that systematically placed borrowers of color into subprime mortgage loan products while placing non-Hispanic white borrowers with similar creditworthiness in prime loans. &nbsp; By steering borrowers into subprime loans from 2004 to 2008, the complaint alleges, Wells Fargo harmed those qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers. &nbsp; Subprime loans generally carried higher-cost terms, such as prepayment penalties and adjustable interest rates that started with low initial teaser rates, and then increased significantly after two or three years, often making the payments unaffordable and leaving the borrowers at a much higher risk of default or foreclosure.The department began its investigation into Wells Fargo’s lending practices in 2009 and received a referral in 2010 from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) which conducted its own parallel investigation of Wells Fargo’s lending practices in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. &nbsp; The OCC found that there was reason to believe that Wells Fargo engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination in these metro areas on the basis of race or color, in violation of the FHA and ECOA.This case was prosecuted by the Fair Lending Unit in the Civil Rights Division’s Housing and Civil Enforcement Section in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. &nbsp; Since the attorney general established the unit in early 2010, it has filed a complaint in or resolved 19 matters. &nbsp; By way of contrast, from 1993 to 2008, the department filed or resolved 37 lending matters, an average of a little more than two cases per year.Today’s announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF). President Obama established the interagency FFETF to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp; The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. &nbsp;&nbsp; The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on the task force, visit www.stopfraud.gov .A copy of the complaint and proposed settlement order, as well as additional information about fair lending enforcement by the Justice Department, can be obtained from the Justice Department website at www.justice.gov/fairhousing .&nbsp;The proposed settlement provides for an independent administrator to contact and distribute payments of compensation at no cost to borrowers whom the Justice Department identifies as victims of Wells Fargo’s discrimination. &nbsp; The department will make a public announcement and post contact information on its website once an administrator is chosen.&nbsp; Borrowers who are eligible for compensation from the settlement will then be contacted by the administrator.&nbsp; Individuals who believe that they may have been victims of lending discrimination by Wells Fargo and have questions about the settlement may&nbsp;email&nbsp;the department at wellsfargo.settlement@usdoj.gov ."

Bailey agreed to the entry of an $855,000 civil judgment against him, after admitting that he violated the Fair Housing Act as alleged in a complaint filed by the Justice Department in federal court, the department announced today.&nbsp; The department’s complaint alleged that Bailey subjected female tenants and applicants for tenancy to unwanted sexual comments and touching, entered the apartments of female tenants without notice or permission, granted tangible housing benefits in exchange for sexual favors and took adverse actions against female tenants when they refused his sexual advances.“The women involved were subjected to intimidating and severe acts of unwanted sexual conduct in their homes, where they expected to feel safe,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.&nbsp; “This judgment reflects the gravity of the alleged conduct.”Under the terms of the consent judgment, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio earlier today, Bailey is obligated to pay $800,000 in damages to 14 women he sexually harassed and $55,000 in a civil penalty to the United States.&nbsp; In addition, the consent judgment enjoins Bailey from further acts of discrimination and requires him to retain an independent management company to manage any currently rented units and any future rental properties he acquires.“This helps right the wrongs committed against vulnerable individuals,” said U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Carter Stewart.&nbsp; “Going forward, the decree sends a message that property owners must respect the rights of their tenants and those who seek safe, secure housing.”The department began investigating Bailey after Housing Opportunities Made Equal, a Cincinnati-based non-profit fair housing advocacy group, notified the department of sexual harassment complaints it had received about Bailey.The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status.&nbsp; Individuals who believe that they may have been victims of housing discrimination should call the Justice Department’s Housing Discrimination Tip Line at 1-800-896-7743, email fairhousing@usdoj.gov or contact the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development at 1-800-669-9777.Fair housing enforcement is a priority of the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.

764,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2328,"Justice Department Settles Housing Discrimination Lawsuit Related to Senior Housing in Santa Rosa, California",,,Housing,"Department of JusticeOffice of Public AffairsFriday, July 27, 2012The Justice Department today announced an agreement with a California municipality and a homeowners’ association to resolve allegations of discrimination on the basis of familial status in violation of the Fair Housing Act.  &nbsp;The settlement, in the form of a consent order, must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.&nbsp;The department’s lawsuit, which was filed on Nov. 21, 2011, alleged that the city of Santa Rosa, Calif., and La Esplanada Unit 1 Owners’ Association, a homeowners’ association, unlawfully sought to restrict residency at a housing development to seniors aged 55 and older. While the law allows an exemption for senior housing, the suit alleged that neither the city nor the homeowners’ association took the steps, such as routine age-verification, necessary to qualify for an exemption to the Fair Housing Act .&nbsp;Under the terms of the consent order, the city of Santa Rosa will not take any enforcement action against the housing development to force it to exclude families with children, and will waive the estimated $12,500 in costs associated with any zoning changes that may be necessary to bring the city’s regulation of the property into compliance with federal law.  &nbsp; Further, when the city, through its zoning code, permits or requires a developer or property owner to operate senior housing, it will, among other things, designate the age restriction of the zoned property in its ordinances and zoning maps, and require that property owners for these developments submit biennial age verifications for the city’s review and certification.  &nbsp; The city will designate an agency to review and certify the biennial certifications.  &nbsp; &nbsp;The homeowners’ association also is prohibited from excluding families with children from the development unless it affirmatively elects to become an age-restricted community for persons 55 years of age or older and conforms to the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.  &nbsp; The Fair Housing Act's requirements include ensuring that at least 80 percent of the occupied units are occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older and ensuring there are proper age verification procedures in place.  &nbsp; In addition, the homeowners’ association will provide compensatory damages to the aggrieved persons in an amount of $44,000 by providing a set-off to amounts it has claimed it is owed by the aggrieved persons.&nbsp;The consent order also requires the homeowners’ association’s officers, agents and employees, as well as city employees and agents with responsibilities related to zoning and land use to receive fair housing training, and requires the homeowners’ association and the city to pay $5,000 each to the United States as a civil penalty.&nbsp; &nbsp;“It is critical that families with children have opportunities to find housing,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.&nbsp;“We are pleased to achieve a resolution in this case that balances the housing rights of families against the ability of a municipality and community to maintain senior housing.”&nbsp;“The resolution of this action is another step in the United States’ continuing commitment to protect all of its citizens and to provide fair housing opportunities for people of all ages,” said Melinda Haag, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. “We are pleased to come to a just and speedy resolution with the city of Santa Rosa and the Homeowners’ Association.”&nbsp;This lawsuit arose as a result of a complaint filed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by the owner and representative of a portion of the condominium development that was the subject of the defendants’ enforcement actions. &nbsp;After HUD investigated the complaint, it issued a charge of discrimination and the matter was referred to the Justice Department.&nbsp;“This settlement gives Santa Rosa a path forward to have senior housing and protect the rights of families with children under the Fair Housing Act,” said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.&nbsp;The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin and disability.&nbsp; More information about the Civil Rights Division and the laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt .&nbsp; Individuals who believe that they have been victims of housing discrimination can call the Housing Discrimination Tip Line at 1-800-896-7743, email the Justice Department at fairhousing@usdoj.gov , or contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777."

Pensions",,Senior Citizens,"The federal Railroad Retirement Board handles this benefit program for eligible workers and their families.General EligibilityLike Social Security, Railroad Retirement benefits are based on months of service and earnings credits. Employees of railroads engaged in interstate commerce, some related industries, railway associations, and national railway labor organizations qualify for Railroad Retirement after 10 years of credited work.Retirement BenefitsRailroad employees with at least 30 years of service can get benefits (called ""annuities"") at a reduced rate at age 60. If they apply at age 62 or later, they qualify for benefits at the full rate. The rate paid depends on the employee's earnings.Employees with fewer than 30 years of service (but at least 10 years) can get reduced benefits at age 62, and full benefits if they apply at age 65.Spouses may be eligible for retirement benefits too, depending on the employee's age at retirement and years of railroad services.A spouse of any age can get a spouse annuity when the employee qualifies for a retirement annuity, so long as the spouse is caring for the employee's unmarried minor child or a child who became disabled before age 22.Divorced spouses may be eligible for an annuity, too. They must have been married to a retired employee for at least ten years and not remarried. Both the retired employee and the ex-spouse must be at least one month older then 62 when the ex-spouse applies.Earnings After RetirementBenefits are not available in any month in which a retired railroad employee works for a railroad industry covered by the retirement benefit law. Other kinds of earnings may result in reductions in benefits, similar to the reductions for Social Security retirement. These reductions end when the retired worker turns full retirement age.Disability BenefitsA railroad employee with at least 10 years of credited service who becomes totally disabled for all regular work can get a disability annuity. For employees 60 or older with 10 years of service or of any age with at least 25 years of service, a second kind of disability annuity is available. This benefit is for employees permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupation. In some cases, disabled employees can get additional (""supplemental"") benefits when they turn age 60 or 65, but they must meet several requirements to do so. The Railroad Retirement Board can give detailed information on these requirements.Survivor's BenefitsThe benefits are available to surviving spouses and children are similar to those offered by Social Security. For families who qualify, a one-time death benefit is available as well.How to ApplyYou must apply to receive any kind of benefit for yourself or your family. Call the nearest Railroad Retirement Board office to schedule an appointment to apply for benefits; be sure to ask what documents you will need to bring to show you are eligible.Your Right to AppealIf the Railroad Retirement Board denies, reduces, or ends your benefits, you may appeal its decision. You can appeal if it says it overpaid you, too. You can be represented by a friend, family member, paralegal, or attorney.

“I notice my neighbor giving lots of her money away…and now she isn’t able to pay her bills.”&nbsp; 

“My brother is taking mom’s Social Security and buying things for himself .”

Financial Elder Abuse:

Not all elder abuse involves physical harm. Financial exploitation is a form of abuse. Examples include scams, undue influence, misuse of a senior’s property, and outright theft. Common signs of financial exploitation include:


	A senior has a sudden, unexplained inability to pay bills or buy necessities
	A senior transfers an unusual amount of money or property to others or has withdrawals or transfers from his account that he cannot explain
	A senior has anew “best friend” with an unusual or suspicious interest in his or her finances and assets
	The senior makes large withdrawals of cash or checks written to “Cash”
	Changes are made to a senior’s advanced directives that they can’t explain or understand
	Someone assists the senior with their finances, but refuses to provide copies of bank statements or an accounting of how funds are being spent.
	Property is missing or being sold without the senior’s consent


An attorney may be able to help a senior recover some money from an abuser through a civil lawsuit. Some of these actions may be considered a crime (theft or fraud). You can call&nbsp; Adult Protection or the police if you suspect financial abuse and would like it to be investigated; or you can call Idaho Legal Aid’s Senior Hotline if you have legal questions related to financial exploitation.

Be smart about Scams:

New scams are created every day and many target seniors. Be wary and don’t buy anything under pressure. YOU CAN SAY NO! Don’t give your credit card number, Social Security number or other personal information to anyone who contacts you over the phone. Don’t pay for anything that comes in the mail if you didn’t order it. The Idaho Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division prints a Senior Citizens Manual that describes many common types of scams that target seniors, such as:


	Telemarketing &amp; Online shopping scams
	Identify Theft &amp; Password problems
	Sweepstakes &amp; Prize scams
	Home Repair &amp; Contractor scams
	Prescription Drug &amp; Medical Aid scams
	Living Trust &amp; Legal scams
	Charity &amp; Church scams


Get a copy of the Manual by calling the Consumer Protection Division 1-800-432-3545 or online at&nbsp; www.ag.idaho.gov. Have you been defrauded? If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; someone defrauds you, call Idaho Legal Aid’s Senior Hotline. You can also file a complaint with the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division and the Better Business Bureau at 1-800-218-1001.

Be smart about Contracts:

Contracts are legally enforceable promises. Some contracts are written and some are spoken. Sometimes people enter into contracts without knowing everything that they’ve promised. Unless you were greatly pressured or deceived about what’s in the contract, a court will probably hold you to the contract. Idaho does not have a “cooling off” period to get out of a contract except for telemarketing and certain door-to-door sales. That’s why seniors should take care to protect themselves from problems with contracts before they sign.&nbsp;

Before you sign any type of contract, READ ALL OF IT.

If you don’t understand anything, ASK QUESTIONS.

DON’T SIGN IT until you understand it.

If the contract has un-filled-in blanks, DON’T SIGN IT!

GET A COPY of the contract and take it home before you sign it!

You can sleep on it! If someone won’t give you a copy,

DON’T SIGN IT!

Did somebody break a contract?

Contracts

If someone has broken a promise that was made to you in a contract, that is called a breach of contract. You can write them a demand letter (send it certified mail, receipt requested), stating what you want them to do (pay you money, finish work, etc.). If that doesn’t work, you may bring a suit for damages (money) that you are owed, but you have to start your lawsuit within a certain time from the date the other party breached the contract. In Idaho, for oral (spoken) contracts, you have four years. For written contracts, you have five years.

Warranties

A warranty is a type of contract that comes when you buy a product and can be express (written or spoken) or implied (something you can assume, like a product will work in the way it’s supposed to). Implied warranties come along with most products, unless they are marked with a disclaimer (tagged “as is” for example). If a company’s product has not performed as promised, that may be a breach of an express or implied warranty, and you may have the right to ask them to honor the warranty and fix the problem or to bring a suit against the product manufacturer or seller of the product; If they won’t honor the warranty, you should discuss your case with a lawyer right away.

Do you have a complaint about merchandise?

You can write a demand letter (certified mail, receipt requested) to the business. Specifically describe your complaint and include a copy of your purchase receipt, contract, warranty or other documents. Keep a copy of your demand letter. If you do not receive a satisfactory response within a reasonable time, you can take follow-up actions such as filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau or the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division (www.ag.idaho.gov). If the amount in dispute is less than $5,000 you can sue in small claims court. The Idaho Consumer Protection Act protects seniors (over 62) and disabled consumers. You may recover triple damages (three times the money that you actually lost) from deceptive merchants in a civil lawsuit. Learn more about filing demand letters and lawsuits on page 40. If the amount of your claim is more than $5,000, then you may want to contact a private attorney to discuss your case.

Be Smart about Loans and Credit

You may get a loan or credit card offer that sounds like a great deal. Or you may seek out a loan because you need cash, and want to sign the loan in a hurry. Be careful, because credit can sometimes cause more problems than it solves. Loan products are often created to make the lender as much money as possible and seniors are often targeted by predatory lenders. Seniors should be very cautious before they use a credit card or sign a loan, especially if they plan to secure the loan with their home, a car title or other property.

KNOW before you sign:

KNOW how many payments you’ll have to make and when the payments are due. Some loans have large “balloon” payments due later that are hard to pay.

Think twice before co-signing a loan:

Many seniors get into trouble because they agree to co-sign on loans for children, grandchildren or other loved ones. This often turns into a disaster as the person they are trying to help fails to make the loan payments and the senior is held fully responsible for the debt.

KNOW your budget:

Can you really make the loan payments and still comfortably afford important living expenses such as rent, food, utilities and medicine?

Don’t hesitate to get help:

Ask an attorney to review the terms of a loan if you are unsure whether they are fair or if you can’t understand the loan documents. Taking a little more time before you sign may save a lot of difficulty later!

Falling behind? Check the facts about the Debt!

You are not legally excused from debts because you have lost your job, get sick, or can’t afford to pay for some other reason. If you owe a creditor, they may report your default to a credit bureau and sue you to collect the debt. The creditor may also sell the debt to a debt buyer or a collection agency to pursue collection.

Collection letters or bills sometimes have errors in them. Keep all records of your debt. Pay attention to the numbers. If you dispute that you owe the debt or the amount of a debt, send a letter to the creditor or collection agency. Keep copies of all the letters that you send and receive about the debt. Contact an attorney to help review the disputed debt. If it has been more than four or five years since you made a payment or charge on the account, then the statute of limitations (time the creditor can legally enforce the debt) may have passed, which could be a defense if a creditor sues you. If you think this may be the case, consult with an attorney.&nbsp;

If you dispute that you owe a debt, write a letter to the collection agency within 30 days of receiving a collection notice to explain why you dispute the debt.

Debt Collectors cannot harass you!

A federal law, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits lenders, collection agencies and their lawyers from:


	Harassing, scaring, or threatening you with violence or criminal prosecution
	Calling you at work if your boss doesn’t allow it.
	Calling your friends or neighbors
	Calling before 8:00 am or after 9:00pm
	Calling or writing you after you send them a “cease communication letter.”


If a collection agency violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you should report the agency to the Idaho Department of Finance (1-888-346-3378). You also have the right to sue collection agencies for $1,000 for each violation of the Fair Debt Collection Act. If you are interested in bringing this type of lawsuit, contact a consumer law attorney.

Writing a Cease Contact Letter:


	Include your account number
	Ask for written proof of the amount you owe
	Ask for a copy of the agency’s Idaho Collection Agent permit
	Request that they stop contacting you.


Even if you do send a cease communication letter, the agency may still sue to collect the debt. You don’t need a lawyer to write this letter. Contact Idaho Legal Aid’s Senior Hotline for a sample letter or visit idaholegalaid.org to download a sample form for free.

You can negotiate with the creditor

You can avoid harassment before it starts by contacting the creditor and explaining your situation. If you offer to make a small payment each month, the creditor may&nbsp;&nbsp; accept the offer and not turn your debt over to a collection agency. If the creditor&nbsp;&nbsp; accepts a lower payment plan, ask them to send you a written agreement showing the new arrangement. If you need help paying debts, you may think about going to a Debt Counseling Service which can counsel you about debt and possibly help work out a new payment plan with your creditor. However, be wary of “Debt Consolidation” companies and some counseling services-- some are scams! Call the Idaho Attorney General’s Office (1-800-432-3545) if you aren't sure about a particular debt consolidation or a debt counseling service.

Are you being sued over debt?

If you owe a debt, the creditor may bring a collection suit against you to get a judgment so they can collect what they’re owed. Sometimes a store or credit card company will sell the right to collect the debt to a debt buyer and the debt buyer will sue you. If you’ve never heard of the company suing you, it might be a debt buyer.

20 days to file an Answer

If you are sued, you will typically receive a Summons (a court document telling you that you are being sued) and a Complaint (a court document that says why you’re being sued). After you receive the Complaint, you have 20 days to file a written Answer with the court. If you have a valid defense to the collection suit, you should bring it up in your Answer. State if you think that the debt isn’t yours, if the amount they are asking for is wrong or if the&nbsp; statute of limitations on the debt has passed. Some collectors have inaccurate records. The collector will have to prove you owed the debt and it may be hard for them to do so. Talk to an&nbsp; attorney about defenses available in your particular case. Answer forms are available through your local Court Assistance Office (courtselfhelp.idaho.gov).

Some common defenses:


	Statute of Limitations. If it’s been over 4-5 years since you last made a payment or charge on the account, the creditor can’t sue to collect the debt.
	Mistaken or Stolen identity. “I didn’t run up this debt!”
	Debt already discharged. “I paid that!” or “I discharged that in bankruptcy!”
	Wrong amount. “My records show I paid part of that debt off!”


What if I don't have a defense?

If you don’t dispute that you owe the debt and you have no other defenses, then you may lose the collection suit, whether you file a written Answer or not. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; filing an Answer may increase the collector’s attorneys’ fees awarded against you. If you lose your case or do not file an Answer, you will receive a paper called a “Judgment,” which is the court’s decision that you owe the money. The creditor may then try to collect the money from you either by asking your employer to garnish your wages (take some of your earnings), asking your bank to give the creditor funds from your bank account, or even taking some of your personal property to sell and collect the money. However, creditors cannot take “exempt” property or income.

A lot of your property and money may be “exempt”

To collect on a judgment, the creditor has to go through a legal process:

After a creditor has a court judgment against you, they can go to the Sheriff and get a “Writ of Execution.” This is a legal paper that allows a creditor to try to take some of your wages, bank account, or property, or put a lien on your real estate (so if you sell it, some of the money goes to the creditor). However, the state of Idaho has declared that some of your property and income is exempt from collections, and cannot be taken or garnished, even if the creditor has a judgment against you!

14 days to claim your exemptions

The sheriff will typically provide you with the Writ of Execution and a Claim of Exemption form. The Claim of Exemption form is your opportunity to tell the creditor what income and assets you have that are protected from being seized.

You MUST fill out and return this form to the Sheriff within 14 days, listing all the items that you claim are exempt.

Here some examples of income or property that are exempt (protected from creditors) under Idaho Law:


	Social Security income
	Retirement benefits, pension funds, IRA’s, and 401k’s
	Veterans Benefits
	Unemployment Benefits
	Public Assistance (AABD, TAFI)
	A motorcycle, car, or truck with a net value up to $7000.
	$7500 worth of appliances, furniture, books, clothing (if none of the things are worth more than $750 by itself)
	$800 worth of miscellaneous other personal property


Be careful not to mix exempt income or funds with non-exempt money like gifts or your wages.

Having the funds mixed together can make the entire amount available to a creditor. Therefore, it is a good idea to keep non-exempt funds in a separate bank account from exempt money or income.

Can a creditor take my home?

Up to $100,000 of the net value (the value of the property minus how much you owe on it) of a house or manufactured home is protected from creditors. This is called a “homestead exemption.” There are many additional exemptions not discussed above. Contact Idaho Legal Aid Services for a detailed list of exemptions and how to claim them. Also, find a free Claim of Exemption form and more information at www.idaholegalaid.org.

Bankruptcy

If you’ve fallen behind on debt, you might have considered declaring bankruptcy. When you file for bankruptcy, the court will issue an “automatic stay” which is an order that will stop most collection activity against you, such as collection calls or garnishment of your wages.

Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13

In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the Court will appoint a Trustee who will sell any non-exempt property you may own, but will allow you to keep exempt property. After a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is finalized, you will receive a discharge of most of your debts (there are some debts that cannot be discharged, such as student loans and tax debts). In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you enter into a repayment plan set by the court and lasting 3-5 years prior to receiving the discharge of remaining debts.&nbsp;

Costs

The filing fee that you must pay the court to start your case is $310 for a Chapter 13 and $335 for a Chapter 7 case (in 2015).&nbsp; If you want to hire an attorney to help you with your case, there will be an additional fee for the attorney. However, many&nbsp;&nbsp; bankruptcy lawyers will let you make payments to pay their fee and the court will sometimes allow you to make payments on the filing fee as well.

Because bankruptcy damages your credit and reduces your credit score, you need to be aware that it will be harder to get credit or loans after you file, and any credit or loans you do qualify for after a bankruptcy will likely have higher interest rates and cost you more.

The timing of when you file your bankruptcy can be very important. If you are considering getting married, getting divorced, or anticipate additional debts in the near future, you should consult with a bankruptcy lawyer before you file. You can contact the Idaho State Bar Lawyer Referral Service at (208) 334-4500 or look online for an attorney at: http://isb.idaho.gov.

Social Security and SSI Benefits

There are three types of Social Security benefits, 1) Retirement, 2) Disability, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Supplemental Security Income (SSI). All are run by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Contact the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 or visit their website at www.ssa.gov for more information. You can find out what benefits you may be eligible for by using SSA’s Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool (BEST) available at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ssabest.benefits.gov.

Social Security Retirement.

When you work and pay taxes, you earn credits&nbsp; toward qualifying for Social Security retirement. You must earn 40 credits (10 years of work) and have reached retirement age (65-67 depending on the year you were born). Before you can begin collecting retirement benefits. The amount of money you get depends on how much you earned over your career. You can get early retirement benefits as early as age 62, but your benefit will be reduced. If you delay your retirement, your benefit amount will be higher.

Social Security Disability. &nbsp;

If you are unable to work due to a disability that is&nbsp; expected to last more than one year or until your death, and have worked during 5 out of the last 10 years, you may qualify for Social Security disability. You can apply for Social Security disability on your own or with the help of an attorney. Most people receive an annual statement which projects their Social Security retirement and disability benefits.&nbsp;

Supplemental Security Income (SSI).

You can qualify for SSI benefits even if you don’t have enough work “credits” to qualify for Social Security retirement or disability, but you must be able to show:


	You are over 65 or blind or disabled
	You are low-income (your income is lower than $733 monthly or $1100 per month if married; these amounts are for 2015, and typically go up annually).
	You have few assets (less than $2000 for single person or $3000 if married, not counting your house).


If your application for disability or SSI is denied you can request a reconsideration, but you have a limited time to do so, so contact a lawyer right away if you need assistance with your request. A free brochure explaining this process is available on the Idaho Legal Aid Services website at www.idaholegalaid.org.

Other Benefits

Veterans' Benefits

Disabled veterans may receive compensation for injuries and diseases they received during military service. Veterans may also receive pensions if they are low income, have few assets and are permanently disabled. There are other veterans’ benefits&nbsp; including payment for medical aids, prosthetics, education and loans. If you are denied VA benefits, you can request a hearing, but must do so quickly. Contact the Veteran’s Affairs regional office nearest you or visit www.va.gov.

Unemployment Benefits

Unemployment benefits are collected from the state after a job loss, such as a layoff or plant closure. The amount you get is based on how much you earned when working. You have 14 days from the time you are denied to protest your denial and request a hearing. Additional information about unemployment benefits, how to apply and appeal forms is available at http://labor.idaho.gov. Or you can call the Idaho Dept. of Labor at 208-332-3570.

Aid to the Aged, Blind &amp; Disabled (AABD)

AABD is a state program that provides cash assistance to individuals who are 65 or older, blind, or disabled. This cash benefit of up to $53 (in 2015) can be used to help cover everyday living expenses. To qualify, your income has to fall below the limit set by the state (below $786 for an individual and $1120 for a couple in 2015). Contact your regional Idaho Dept. of Health and Welfare (IDHW) office to apply for AABD.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

SNAP helps low income families by providing funds to buy food. In order to qualify, your income has to be below $1,265 for a single person or $1,705 for a couple (2015) and your resources or assets have to be below $5,000. You also have to be a citizen, a resident of Idaho, and either employed, in a training program, elderly (age 60+), or disabled. Contact your regional IDHW office to apply for SNAP benefits.

General Tips About Government Benefits

Apply early.&nbsp; Apply for benefits programs well before the time you think you’ll need the financial help. The application process can be confusing, and you may need to&nbsp;&nbsp; gather lots of personal and financial information to fill out the application.

Write it down!&nbsp; Keep every written statement you get from a government agency in a special file. Read everything carefully and pay attention to dates! Keep a written record of every time you call a government agency when you are applying. Write down the person’s name, what they tell you and what you tell them.

Appeal denials.&nbsp; If you’ve been improperly denied a benefit, or if your payment is reduced or cut off, you may have want to appeal that decision. You can appeal on your own or with the help of an attorney. Don’t wait to take action, because there are short time limits for requesting appeals!

Medicare.&nbsp;

Medicare is federal health insurance for people who: 1) are age 65 and over or, 2) have received Social Security disability benefits for over 2 years.&nbsp; Medicare, like other health insurance, has premiums, co-payments, and deductibles.

Medicare covers certain health expenses:


	reasonable and necessary hospital stays
	short stays in skilled nursing facilities
	certain home health care needs
	hospice services
	certain doctor visits, ambulance rides, medical aids and prosthetics.
	Long term care is only covered by Medicare in very&nbsp; limited circumstances and only for a short amount of time


If you are in a hospital or nursing facility, and you are told that Medicare will no longer pay for you to stay there, you have a right to appeal. It’s important to ask for an appeal quickly. When you are denied coverage for a medical service or expense, you should receive written notice of non-coverage from the doctor or hospital. This notice, called a Medicare Summary Notice, will explain how to appeal.

If you have questions about Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit medicare.gov

Medicaid.&nbsp;

Medicaid is a federal health program for people with low income, regardless of whether they have worked or not.

Are you eligible for Medicaid?

Medicaid helps many low-income people pay for medical necessities. Medicaid can provide full health coverage such as for physician visits and hospital stays, but only for qualifying children under age 19, pregnant women, adults with a child under 19, seniors age 65 or older, or persons who are blind or disabled.

Medicaid can also pay the costs of long term care such as in-home nursing, assisted living, or nursing home care.

You may be eligible for Medicaid to cover long term care costs if:


	Your income is less than Medicaid’s income cap ($2,199 for a single person in 2015); and
	Your assets (property) are below the Medicaid asset cap ($2,000 for a single person, but much higher for a married couple, meet with an attorney to discuss asset requirements for a married couple); and
	You have a demonstrated medical need for the long term care.


Medicaid’s Limit on Income

Many people discover that they do not have enough income or savings to pay the high costs of long term care; yet they may have too much income to qualify for Medicaid. If your income is above the income cap, you can still qualify for Medicaid long term care coverage through use of a special type of trust, called a “Miller Trust.”

“Miller Trusts” are basically agreements where one person (called the “trustee”) agrees to hold and manage money for another person who needs long term care (called the “beneficiary”), and promises to spend the money only in ways approved by Idaho Dept. of Health &amp; Welfare (primarily paying long term care costs). Income that goes into the trust is not counted and therefore the trust can help a person become eligible for Medicaid. Because Miller Trusts can be confusing, and can be ineffective if not done correctly, it is important to contact an attorney if you need a Miller Trust or have questions about qualifying for Medicaid.

Medicaid’s Limit on Assets

If you have too many “non-exempt” assets to qualify for Medicaid, you can “spend down” your assets in order to qualify. However, if your assets significantly exceed the $2,000 cap, or if you are married, you should not spend down without first talking to a lawyer. If your assets are only slightly over the cap, your spend down options could include: paying for long term care out of pocket; purchasing exempt assets such clothing and personal items, a vehicle, or an irrevocable burial fund; or spending the money on other goods or services. Spending down can be very complex and may have tax consequences. If you are married or have significant assets, you should consult with an attorney.

Transfer Penalty

Many people think that they can just give away assets to meet Medicaid’s asset cap. However, this may cause a penalty, disqualifying you from receiving Medicaid benefits for a period of time. For example, if you give away a house to a daughter or son, Medicaid will calculate the value of the gift and divide that by the number of months that it thinks you could have paid for your own long term care. It will then disqualify you for Medicaid for that number of months. For a house worth about $150,000, the penalty can be over two years. Medicaid looks back five years from the time you apply to see if you gave away (transferred) any assets for less than market value. If you want to gift property away, but are concerned about future Medicaid eligibility, you should meet with a lawyer to discuss your case.

Estate Recovery: Medicaid gets paid back

You may have heard that Medicaid will put a lien on your house or take your property. This is partially true: Medicaid does not take anything during your lifetime, but after you pass away, they can make a claim against your estate for the amount they paid for your care. Medicaid will not go after an estate, though, until after both the Medicaid recipient and his spouse have passed away. Also, if you have children with disabilities, you should consult with an attorney regarding rights they may have.

Senior Health Care Issues

County Assistance

If you cannot afford hospital and medical care, including medications, or basic necessities such as rent, food, and utilities, then the county may assist you in paying for them. This is a ""last resort"" program. This means that the county will pay for these services or necessities only if you have no other way of paying for them on a temporary basis. Additionally, the County can put a lien your property until such assistance is repaid.

Should I get Long Term Care Insurance?

Long-term care insurance may help pay for long-term care services if you buy it in advance and pay the premiums for a certain time. Long-term care insurance may not be a good option for you if: you cannot afford premiums; you have very limited&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assets; your only income is Social Security or Supplemental Security Income (SSI); or you often have trouble paying for utilities, food, medicine, or other basic needs. However, long term care insurance can be quite beneficial for people with significant assets. If you are interested in purchasing long term care insurance, consider a policy that is part of Idaho’s Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership Program. These policies earn credit for benefits paid out by the insurer, so the insured person could qualify for Medicaid without having to spend down all of her assets.&nbsp;

Institutional Elder Abuse


“When we went to visit mom at the nursing home, she had bruises and hadn’t eaten for two days. I don’t think she’s being taken care of.”


Sadly, seniors may experience abuse while in the care of nursing homes and other institutions. Friends and family members should monitor if their loved ones:


	haven’t eaten enough
	have bedsores or other injuries
	aren’t getting their medicine
	are missing personal items
	complain about verbal or physical abuse from the staff
	seem mistreated


The Ombudsman Responds to Institutional Abuse

Ombudsmen advocate for the elderly. They investigate complaints and respond to requests for assistance from older individuals living in long-term care facilities as well as from those living in the community in residential care or assisted living facilities. Ombudsman services are free.

539,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2043,Your Home,,,Senior Citizens,"Renter’s Rights

Tenants have certain rights under Idaho law:


	The right not to be discriminated against when looking for a place to rent or during the tenancy.
	The right to have a rental properties that is not dangerous or unhealthy.
	The right to request needed repairs and have the landlord address the repairs within 3 days.
	Landlord cannot evict without going through the proper court process.
	Landlords cannot unfairly keep the renters’ security deposit if there is no damage
	Discrimination in Housing


Landlords cannot discriminate against you because of your sex, race, color, religion, disability, national origin, or familial status (whether you have children or not). These are called the protected classes. This applies when you are looking for a rental and when you already are living in one.

If you think you might have suffered discrimination because you belong to a protected class, call one of these numbers:

Idaho Human Rights Commission (888) 249-7025 or (208) 334-4751 (TTY)

Intermountain Fair Housing Council 383-0695 or 1-800-717-0695 (TTY)

HUD / Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Office 1-800-877-0246

You may request a reasonable accommodation

A “reasonable accommodation” allows you as a tenant to request a change to a landlord or rental agency’s rules or policies (like requesting a first floor unit). A “reasonable modification” is a change to the physical structure (like building a ramp or lowering a countertop) that allows a person with a disability to fully use and enjoy their housing.

The accommodation that you ask for must be reasonable, which means it cannot place an undue financial or administrative burden on the housing provider. For example, asking your landlord to help pay your bills or drive you to appointments might be an undue burden and unreasonable. However, asking your landlord to relax a “no pets” policy so you can live with your assistive animal would likely not be an&nbsp;&nbsp; undue burden and is likely reasonable. You may have to ask a qualified health professional to write a letter stating that you are disabled and that your disability is connected to the accommodation you are requesting. The letter should not discuss details about your disability, which is confidential health care information. Contact&nbsp; Idaho Legal Aid Services or Intermountain Fair Housing Council if you have questions. You can also download free, interactive forms at www.idaholegalaid.org, including Reasonable Accommodation request forms.

More Renters’ Rights

Repairs

Idaho law (Code Sections 6-320 and 6-321) gives tenants the right to sue a landlord if he has failed to make certain repairs within 3 days of a written request. These repairs are:


	Water-proofing, weather-protection
	Electrical &amp; Plumbing
	Heating, Ventilation, Cooling
	Sanitary facilities
	Installation of a smoke detector
	Other conditions hazardous to health or safety


If you need repairs, send your landlord a written demand letter. Keep a copy of the letter for your records and send it by certified mail or hand deliver it with a witness. If the landlord does nothing, you can sue them for any damages and costs you suffered because he didn’t make the repair, or you can sue to get a court order forcing him to make the repairs. Idaho law does not allow tenants to make repairs and deduct the repair costs from rent. You can download a free interactive form to request repairs from your landlord and learn more about your right to live in a safe, healthy rental property at www.idaholegalaid.org.

Security Deposit

When you move out of a rental, make sure to take lots of pictures to show the condition of the property. Your landlord has 21-30 days from the date you move out to return your deposit or to provide you an itemized list of charges. If your landlord fails to return your deposit, or you disagree with charges the landlord is claiming, send them a demand letter. If you and the landlord cannot reach an agreement, you can sue the landlord in small claims court (for up to $5,000) and can ask the judge for triple your deposit amount back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Manufactured Home Owners

If you own a manufactured home and are renting a lot, you have unique rights, spelled out in Idaho’s Manufactured Home Residency Act (Idaho Code Sections 55-2001 through 55-2019). For example, the landlord has to give you 90 days written&nbsp; notice if she: does not intend to renew your lease, wants to raise your rent, or wants to change the Community’s Rules. The landlord also cannot evict you for complaining about the health and safety of the community or for joining a Tenants’ Association.

Evictions

Receiving an eviction notice or just a threat of eviction can be terrifying. Know that you have a right to a proper eviction notice before your landlord evicts you. Often a landlord may have to give you a chance to fix a mistake you made or pay rent if your rent is late.

The landlord has a right to evict you for only certain reasons:


	If you don’t pay rent on time (even if you have a good reason like you lost your job or the place needs repairs)
	If you violate the lease agreement
	If you have a month-to-month lease and the landlord gives you 30 days’ notice


The landlord cannot evict you for any of these reasons:


	Because you request repairs
	Because you complain about housing code violations
	Because you join a tenants’ association
	Because you request a reasonable accommodation or modification
	Because you are a member of a protected class


If a landlord wants to evict you, she has to give you a proper eviction notice. If you violate the lease agreement or you are behind on rent, the landlord has to give you a notice that gives you 3 days to “cure” (fix) the violation or pay your rent. If you “cure” the lease violation in those 3 days, then you can’t be evicted. If you don’t cure and don’t move out, your landlord can bring an eviction suit against you. Your landlord cannot, however, try to force you out by turning off utilities or locking you out.

If you think you are being treated unfairly or evicted illegally, contact Idaho Legal Aid Services. You can find more information and a free, interactive form to use when you need to respond to an eviction notice at: www.idaholegalaid.org.

Housing Issues

Federal Housing Programs

There are several kinds of Federal Housing Programs. Some give tenants “vouchers” to help pay rent for houses and apartments owned by private landlords. In other programs, a government agency charges rent at a reduced rate, based on a tenant’s ability to pay. You have to apply to get into one of the programs. Many have a waiting list before you are accepted.

Federal housing programs sometimes offer additional tenant protections. For example, you might get to have special notice before your landlord attempts to raise rent or evict you. Or your lease might require that you cannot be evicted except for “good cause.” Make sure to read your lease agreement carefully so you are aware of any additional rights you may have. If you have questions about federal housing programs, you can contact your local housing authority or Idaho Legal Aid office.

I’m getting foreclosed upon. Do I have any rights?

Millions of people, including seniors, have found themselves facing foreclosure in the last few years. There are often options to help you avoid foreclosure, such as a loan modification to reduce your interest rate, or a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure if you no longer want the home. You may qualify for free legal services from Idaho Legal Aid Services if you are a homeowner facing foreclosure. Make sure to act quickly because there are time limits for requesting certain types of assistance.

Housing counselors are also available to help homeowners avoid foreclosure:

	Community Action Partnership Agency in Lewiston 208-746-3351 ex. 4187 or 1-800-326-4843


Reverse Mortgages

Many seniors have heard about reverse mortgages as a way to pay off other debts, avoid a foreclosure, or have extra income in retirement. A reverse mortgage allows a person age 62 or older to convert equity in their home into cash without having to sell the home or re-pay the loan in monthly payments. The reverse mortgage is paid off when you move out of the home or upon your death. Before you take out a reverse mortgage, it’s important to understand that the costs and fees can be high, there may not be any equity in your home to leave to your heirs, interest rates may be variable and change over time, and you should consider what will happen to your spouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; especially if he or she isn’t included on the reverse mortgage loan agreement. For more information about reverse mortgages, you can call the U.S. Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Development (HUD) at 1-800-CALL-FHA or AARP at 1-800-209-8085.

Filing for Divorce

Idaho is a “no fault” divorce state, which means that you don’t have to prove that your spouse did anything wrong in order to get a divorce and you do not need your spouse’s consent to file. You just need to prove that there are “irreconcilable differences” between you and your spouse.

Residency. You must live in Idaho for six full weeks in a row before filing for divorce.

Community Property &amp; Debt. In Idaho, a court will assume that both spouses contributed equally to the marriage, even if only one spouse worked. The property earned by either spouse during the marriage is called “community property” and will usually be split 50/50 at divorce. The community’s debts will also be divided equally. However, you can ask for a different arrangement if your unique situation (income, age, illness, etc.) justifies a different division.

Pro se. You can file divorce “pro se” (by yourself, without an attorney). All of the forms you will need are available at the Court’s Assistance Office of your local county’s courthouse, and also online at: www.courtselfhelp.idaho.gov. Find more information and download free, interactive legal forms you can use to file for divorce at: www.idaholegalaid.org.

Grandparents Raising Grandchildren

Grandparents sometimes have difficulty proving to hospitals or schools they have authority to make decisions for a grandchild. If you are taking care of your grandchild, even for a short time, you should get written permission (called a parental power of attorney) from at least one of the child’s parents. The parental power of attorney form is available at idaholegalaid.org. If you are raising your grandchild for a longer period of time, you may ask a court to declare that you are your grandchild’s permanent legal guardian. This will give you legal authority to care for a grandchild and will often let you place your grandchild on your health insurance.

Petitioning for Guardianship of a Minor

To become a child’s guardian, you have to show a judge that you are qualified to be the child’s guardian and that a guardianship is in the best interest of the child. You also have to show the court that the child’s parents have abused, neglected or abandoned the child or cannot provide a stable home environment. If the parent fails to keep a “normal parental relationship” for six months without a good excuse, the court will assume that the parent has abandoned the child. You will have to send notices to the child’s parents that you are petitioning for a guardianship. The court will likely appoint a Guardian ad litem (an attorney) to speak for the child during the process. If you are appointed guardian, you will have to file an Annual Report with the court. An attorney is generally needed to successfully pursue a guardianship case. You can find resources for grandparents raising a grandchild at: http://www.211.idaho.gov/kincare/Kincare.html.

Guardianships &amp; Conservatorships of Adults

If a person loses the ability to take care of their own health and safety, a concerned friend or family member may ask the Court to appoint a Guardian (someone to make personal decisions about matters such as health care and housing) and/or a Conservator (someone to make decisions about money) for the protected person. In order for a court to grant a guardianship or conservatorship, it must find that the protected person is incapacitated. If there is an urgent risk that the person will be greatly harmed (by themselves or others), a temporary guardian can be appointed. This kind of emergency guardianship only lasts 90 days, during which time a permanent guardianship can be pursued.

The Court will take precautions to make sure that the protected person is taken care of and actually needs someone to make decisions for her. The protected person has to receive notice about the proposed guardianship. The court will appoint a court visitor who interviews the protected person and the proposed guardian, visits where the protected person will live, and makes a report for the court. The court will also appoint a physician to examine the protected person and give a written opinion regarding whether she is incapacitated. Finally, the court will appoint a Guardian ad litem (an attorney) to represent the protected person’s interests. The court will review the recommendations of the physician, court visitor, and Guardian ad Litem and hold a hearing to determine whether a guardianship and/or conservatorship is needed. The protected person has the right to attend this hearing, and the right to hire their own private attorney.

Guardians must pass an online training course and submit a yearly report to the court about the protected person’s health and living situation and Conservators must submit annual accountings to the Court about the protected person’s income, expenses and assets. You can find free Conservator and Guardian reporting forms at www.courtselfhelp.idaho.gov, and a free Guardian’s Annual Report form at www.idaholegalaid.org/SelfHelp/GuardianAnnualReport.

Complaints

If you have reason to believe that a guardian or conservator is not fulfilling their duties to the protected person (e.g., stealing money, withholding medical treatment, failing to provide necessary food or shelter, etc.), then you can file a Guardianship-Conservatorship Complaint with the court. The form is available at idaholegalaid.org or through your local Court Assistance Office.

"
541,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2045,Your Future,,,Senior Citizens,"Advance Directives

You may have had a doctor or friend tell you that you need a legal document called a “power of attorney.” Sometimes these documents are called “advance directives.” There are several different kinds of “power of attorney” documents but they all have a similar purpose: they let you decide who will make important decisions for you if you can’t. Because this is a very important power, you should take care that you know what you are signing and talk to an attorney if you have any questions or concerns.

Capacity: know what you’re doing

To make a “power of attorney” document, you must have legal “capacity.” That is, you must know what it is you’re signing, and why you’re signing it. You must also know who you’re picking to have your legal powers, what powers they’ll have, and when.

Durable: Lasting your whole life

Before signing any type of “power of attorney,” you should make sure that it is “durable.” Durable means that it will last even beyond the point where you cannot make decisions (when you lack capacity).

Immediate vs. Springing: Now vs. Later

You can decide if you want your powers of attorney to be “immediate” or “springing.” Immediate means exactly that: the agent will have power to decide about your health care or finances right after it is signed. You might want to have the document be “springing” however. That is, it will “spring” into action when some condition happens. Most commonly, people will make their power of attorney become effective only after a doctor has stated in writing that they are no longer competent to make those decisions themselves.

Revocability: You can change your mind.

You can change the person who you name as power of attorney at any time, as long as you have capacity. You can simply revoke your current document or execute a new one, dating it so it is clear that it replaces the first document. These are your&nbsp;&nbsp; legal powers, so you should be the one to choose who gets to have them! If you&nbsp; revoke or change a power of attorney document, make sure that anyone who may have dealt with the old document, gets copies of your new or updated power of attorney or revocation.

Who should you pick as your agent?

The person you choose to have your Powers of Attorney should be a trusted friend or family member. It is a very important decision and you should not be pressured into choosing someone against your wishes. You should have serious talks with your agent so you know they understand what your wishes and beliefs are and are capable and comfortable acting in your best interest.

Powers over Health, Powers over Money

There are two main types of “power of attorney” documents: Power of Attorney for Health Care and Power of Attorney for Financial Affairs. The first document lets everyone know who you want to make decisions about your health when you cannot communicate with your health care providers. For example, the person you name could make the decision about whether or not to allow a surgery if you were unconscious. A power of attorney for finances gives your agent powers over your&nbsp;&nbsp; financial and legal matters such as accessing bank accounts, paying debts, signing contracts, signing up for government benefits, etc. You get to choose which specific powers to give to your agent and which powers she will not need to have. If your agent will deal with real property&nbsp; (a house or land) for you, make sure to have the power of attorney notarized.

Living Will

A “Living Will” is often made at the same time and in the same document as a power of attorney for health care. A Living Will gives your health care providers instructions regarding what life sustaining systems you want to have provided or withheld, in the event you are unable to express your own wishes due to an incurable and terminal condition or persistent vegetative state. A Living Will allows you to decide ahead of time what will happen in these situations. You have three main options:


	provide all life sustaining measures;
	remove life sustaining measures except to provide hydration (via an IV) and/or nutrition (via feeding tube); or
	remove all life sustaining measures. A Living Will form is available at idaholegalaid.org, or you can discuss this document with your doctor.


Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care

A Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA) for health care is a document where you declare who you want to make health care decisions when you are unable to make them. A common example is when you are unconscious after an auto accident. It tells your doctors who to talk to about different medical options or procedures on your behalf. If you wish, you can leave specific, special instructions about your care for your agent.

The living will and DPOA for health care do not have to be witnessed or notarized.&nbsp;After you sign, keep the original and give copies to your agents and doctors. You can also register the documents for free with the Idaho Secretary of State. Low income seniors may be able to get free help drafting advance directives and powers of attorney by contacting Idaho Legal Aid Services.

Leaving a Will or Dying “Intestate”

Most people know that it’s important to create a will to show who should get their property when they die. Yet most people do not have a will. If you die in Idaho without a will (that is, you die “intestate”), the state will determine how your property will be distributed through laws called “intestacy statutes.” These laws are the state’s attempt to distribute your property as you would have probably wanted. It’s easy to imagine that the laws might distribute your property in a way that you&nbsp; wouldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp; necessarily have wanted. That’s why having a valid will is important as it will carry out your wishes and determine who gets what. You do not necessarily need a lawyer to help write your will. However, if may be best to ask for help from a lawyer,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially if you own significant assets like land or a house, or you have family members who don’t get along with each other.

Requirements for a typed will:


	A statement of testamentary intent (basically, a sentence saying you want this to be your final will)
	Capacity (you are over 18, of sound mind, not signing under duress)
	Your signature and date
	Two witness who swear that you signed the will and then must sign the will themselves.


Requirements for a handwritten (“holographic”) will:


	All the important parts of the will must be in your handwriting (not typed).
	A statement of testamentary intent (basically, a sentence saying you want this to be your final will)
	Capacity (you are over 18, of sound mind, not signing under duress)
	You must sign it.
	You must date it.


Changing your Will

You can add something to a valid will or change it by doing a “codicil.” You can make a codicil it in the same way you execute a will. (For example, signing, dating, having two witnesses).

Revoking a Will


	Tearing it up (along with all copies)
	Writing “revoked” on it
	Writing a new will dated after the old one


These requirements are VERY general. The laws of wills and probate are complex. Contact an attorney if you have any questions.

Avoiding Probate?

Probate is a court process where the estate of someone who has died is administered. Probate has a bad reputation and many people think they should “avoid probate.” Probate does not have to be time-consuming or expensive, especially for people with relatively small estates (less than $100,000). In rare cases, however, (often involving family disputes over large estates), probate can be expensive and take years. You also may believe that you need to avoid probate to avoid estate taxes. However, estate taxes only apply to estates valued at over $5 million (in 2015) and therefore are not a concern for most Idahoans.

In some circumstances, simplified probate procedures can be used:


	If your spouse dies, and you were the sole heir, you may be able to use an Affidavit in Lieu of Probate or Summary Administration for a Surviving Spouse.
	If an estate is smaller than $100,000 and contained no real property, $100,000, the heir(s) can fill out an&nbsp; Affidavit for Collection of Personal Property that allows him or her to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collect personal belongings and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; documents of the deceased person.


It’s probably best to contact an attorney with questions about probate if your spouse or relative dies because there are many variables. If you do use a lawyer to go through probate, it is usually preferable to have them charge you a flat fee (for very small estates) or an hourly rate or and not a “percentage fee.” Don’t be afraid to go to a different attorney if you think you’re being charged too much.

Should I get a living trust?

Property placed into living trusts does not have to go through probate, so this may simplify transfers of ownership after your death. Because factors such as the size of your estate and your unique estate planning goals, you should consult with a licensed Idaho attorney if you have questions about living trusts. Living Trusts are not for everybody. Take time to make decisions about your estate and talk to a trusted attorney before buying a living trust.

542,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2046,Your Rights,,,Senior Citizens,"Age &amp; Disability Discrimination

Employment discrimination means treating people differently in the workplace (hiring, firing, promotions, wages, training opportunities, etc.) because of their age or disability. There are two main laws that protect older people from discrimination by employers. The Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), found at 29 U.S. Code Section 621, protects workers against age discrimination by employers who have 20 or more employees.

Idaho’s anti-discrimination law is found at Idaho Code Section 67-5909 and it prohibits employment discrimination based on age (being age 40 and older) or disability. However, if a person has a particular disability that prevents a person from performing the work required by that employer, even with a reasonable accommodation, then the employer is not required to hire that person.

If you think you might have been discriminated against in the workplace because of your age, you should call the Idaho Human Rights Commission as soon as possible. Under federal law, you must file your complaint within 300 days (a little less than a year) from the date you were discriminated against. You do not need a lawyer to file a complaint.

If you were denied a job because of your age or disability, you can file a complaint with:

Defending Your Rights

You may find it necessary to use the court system to enforce one of your rights described in this Guidebook. In many cases, it will be a good idea to have a lawyer to help you in court.

However, you can take steps to defend your rights with or without an attorney. Practice “legal self-defense.” Remember these “tricks of the trade”:


	Get it in writing
	Make copies
	Keep records
	Don’t sign what you don’t understand
	Feel free to say no
	Take along a witness
	Take photos or videos if you can Look up the law
	Ask what the other person knows about the law
	Write reasonable demand letters
	Be aware of time limits and statutes of limitations


If you have a disagreement with someone, writing a letter stating your rights or referencing the applicable law can have powerful effect. Send it “certified mail” or hand deliver it with a witness to prove the other person received it. Even if the person doesn’t respond, a copy of your letter may help your case if you have to sue.

Small Claims Court

Small Claims Court is available for disputes less than $5000. If your demand letter doesn’t work, you may have to sue in Small Claims Court. Neither side can have an attorney in Small Claims Court, so you will have to sue “pro se,” which means by yourself. However, you can prove your case to the judge by bringing&nbsp; witnesses, photographs, documents, and other evidence, just like an attorney. There is a fee to file in Small Claims Court, but if you can’t afford it, you can apply for a fee waiver.

The Court Assistance Office in each County Courthouse has all the forms you will need to help file your Small Claims Lawsuit and information on how to collect your money if you win. These forms are also available online at www.idaholegalaid.org.

Mediation

Mediation may also be a good option: it can take less time and be less hostile than a lawsuit. Mediators are available in the phone book or through the Idaho Mediation Association.

Small claims court is only available for limited types of cases. If your case is not the type that is heard in small claims court, it will be filed in an Idaho Magistrate Court, an Idaho District Court, or, less frequently, in a Federal Court. Although having an&nbsp;&nbsp; attorney is not required in these cases, you may need a lawyer to bring your suit&nbsp;&nbsp; successfully because the rules regarding your witnesses and evidence are not as&nbsp; relaxed as in Small Claims Court and the judge is required to hold you to the same standards as an attorney.

What if someone is suing you?

If you receive a Complaint and Summons, the Court Assistance Office at the county courthouse has forms available so you can file an Answer as a defendant in a lawsuit. In many cases, you must file your Answer within 20 days. Carefully read the plaintiff’s claims in the Complaint. You will have to admit or deny each of the claims in your Answer, and state any defenses you have. You then must sign the Answer in front of a notary and have it property served on the other party and filed with the court. The Answer form should come with instructions, which you should follow carefully.

You can find a private attorney through the Idaho State Bar Private Attorney Referral Service or through Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program if you are low income and have a qualifying case.

&nbsp;Idaho Lawyer Referral Service: isb.idaho.gov or&nbsp; 208-334-4500

&nbsp;Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program: 208-334-4510 or 1-800-221-3295

What to expect when you meet your lawyer:


	Your lawyer will ask you a lot of questions about your case and what results you want
	Be prepared with a timeline of relevant events and copies of all relevant documents


Your lawyer should explain to you:


	Duty of Confidentiality (which means that your lawyer cannot discuss your case with others without your permission)
	Your role
	The lawyers role
	The steps in the legal process
	Your legal options
	Your chances of getting what you want
	The risks you may face, if any
	The limits of the representation

551,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2066,Your Safety,,,Senior Citizens,"Know about Elder Abuse 

What is “elder abuse?”

Elder Abuse has many forms. It can mean any mistreatment of a senior. Examples&nbsp;&nbsp; include confinement, neglect, abandonment, bodily injury, unwanted sexual contact, verbal intimidation and threats, and financial exploitation.

Myth: “We don't have that problem in our community.”

Fact: Abuse is often not seen or recognized.

Some people believe that elder abuse is not a problem in their community. Unfortunately, every community, no matter the size, nationality, income, or religion, has its share of invisible seniors suffering from abuse, neglect or exploitation.

Myth: “It's just part of growing old.”

Fact: Abuse is preventable. It should not be tolerated by anyone.

Every senior deserves respect, and no one should tolerate abuse. No senior should be physically harmed, deprived of food or medicine, sexually harassed, unreasonably coerced to live where they don’t want to, or have their money or property misused or stolen.

Elder Abuse May Look Like:


	Emotional and verbal abuse
	Physical abuse or restraint
	Neglect
	Financial exploitation
	Not letting other friends or family members see the elder.
	Abusers may be: family members, caregivers, trusted friends


Civil remedies.&nbsp; If you are the victim of abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation, one remedy you have is the ability to revoke a power of attorney document if the person named in that document is not acting in your interest. You also have the option of bringing a civil lawsuit against an abusive party. A civil lawsuit is a non-criminal case that seeks money to compensate for physical or financial harms. For example, if an adult child took money from a senior’s bank account without her permission, a civil lawsuit could be filed to try and get the money returned. If you are interested in pursuing a civil lawsuit, you may want to talk with an attorney about your case. Another option available to victims of physical or sexual abuse is the Civil Protection Order (CPO), which orders an abusive family member or household member to stay away from you. To get a CPO, you apply at the local courthouse and give a sworn statement. A free CPO form is also available at idaholegalaid.org.

Criminal remedies.&nbsp; Criminal remedies are focused on punishing a person who has violated the law. Several Idaho laws protect seniors from fraud, theft, physical abuse, neglect, and unwanted sexual contact. If you suspect that you are a victim of a crime, you can call the police and they will investigate. Filing criminal charges can be helpful in ensuring your safety by getting an abuser behind bars and because you can request a No Contact Order in some criminal cases.

What to know:

You shouldn’t have to live in fear or violence.

You don’t deserve abuse.

It’s not your fault if someone is abusing you.

You can make decisions for yourself.

People should have your permission to make decisions for you.

You can find help.

Many people have experienced what you are going through.

Know who to call:

If you or someone else is in danger, call 911.

If you are suffering from ongoing abuse or neglect, call Adult Protection Services. Adult Protection Investigates allegations of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, and exploitation of vulnerable adults. Adult Protection can work with the police, Health and Welfare, nursing homes, banks and lawyers to investigate and address cases of abuse and neglect.

If you, a neighbor, friend, or family member is suffering abuse or neglect at the hands of an another person, call Adult Protection Services. You can learn more about Adult Protection on the Idaho Commission on Aging’s website: www.aging.idaho.gov.&nbsp;

Social Security/SSI",,Social Security,"The Social Security Administration manages Social Security benefits. Social  Security is a federal program providing benefits to eligible workers and their families  when the worker retires, becomes disabled, or dies. General Eligibility To qualify for Social Security, you must have worked in a job where you or  your employer paid the Social Security tax. Certain relatives also may qualify for  benefits on your account. You must have worked a certain amount of time to earn quarters of coverage, or credits. You must in 2003 earn at least $890 in a quarter to  receive a credit. When you earn enough credits, you become eligible for benefits. The  amount of benefits you will receive each month depends upon the amount of your average  yearly earnings. Retirement Benefits You must meet the following requirements to be eligible for retirement  benefits: You are 62 or olderYou have enough creditsYou are retired or are employed and have limited earnings. Your spouse and unmarried children may also receive benefits when you do  based on your earnings if one of the following applies: Your spouse is 62 or olderYour non-working spouse is younger than 62 and is caring for your child who is younger than 16 or disabled Your non-working divorced spouse also may receive benefits if one of the  following applies: He or she is 62 or olderHe or she is younger than 62, has not remarried, and is caring for your child who is younger than 16; and you were married to each other for at least    10 years. Early Retirement Your check will be permanently reduced by 5/9 of 1 % for every month that you  receive Early Retirement benefits, before your retirement age of 65. Your Social  Security will not be reduced if your benefits are disability benefits. Earnings After Retirement If you are younger than 65 and not receiving disability, your earnings may  reduce the amount of your Early Retirement Social Security benefits that you receive. Your  benefits will not be affected, however, if you are older than 65. If you are earning  money in the same year as when you turned 65, but have not yet turned 65, your Social  Security income will be reduced by one dollar for every three dollars of gross monthly earnings  above $2560; otherwise, prior to your 65th birth date your Early Retirement will be  reduced by one dollar for every two dollars of monthly gross earnings above $960. Disability Benefits Disability means diagnosed health problem(s) that stops you from performing  substantial gainful employment. If you have enough credits and become disabled before age  65, you may be eligible for disability benefits. Certain relatives may also be eligible  with you.  You may qualify for disability benefits if: You cannot do any substantial kind of work because of diagnosed health    problems, considering your age, education, and work experienceThe health problems either will result in death or is expected to or have    lasted for 12 or more monthsYou worked under Social Security and earned 20 credits (one credit for    each quarter you worked) in the ten years immediately before you became disabled. If you qualify for disability payments, your children, spouse, and former  spouse also may qualify for payments. After you have received disability benefits for 24 months, you will be  eligible for Medicare federal health insurance. Disability benefits can begin one year prior  to your application. Disability benefits cannot begin until five full calendar months  have passed since the month in which you first became disabled. Survivor's Benefits If you are insured at the time of your death, a family member may receive  benefits if he or she is: A widow(er) age 60 or olderA widow(er) at least 50 who becomes disabled within seven years of your    death; or within seven years from the time she or he received benefits on your work recordA surviving divorced spouse who meets either requirement #1 or #2 and was married to you at least 10 yearsAn unmarried dependent child younger than 18 or an unmarried child who has    been continuously disabled since prior to age 22. A surviving widow(er) or dependent children can receive a lump sum death  benefit of $255 in addition to monthly survivor benefits. Your Right to AppealIf Social Security denies, reduces, or ends your benefits you may appeal the  decision.  Generally, you have 65 days from the date on the notice to appeal. If you are  already receiving benefits, you can ask for continued benefits until you receive a face  to face hearing. However, to do so, you must ask within 15 days of the date on the  notice for continuation of the benefits. If you lose, you may have to pay the money back.  Do not get discouraged if you are denied. Mistakes are made."

534,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/2036,Idahoans Appeal Cuts to Cash Assistance Program ,,,State and Local Welfare,"By REBECCA BOONE&nbsp;-&nbsp;Associated PressPublished: 05/31/11BOISE, Idaho —   More than 100 people gathered at the Idaho Department of Health and  Welfare to attend a hearing over whether they'll be able to appeal cuts  to the state's cash assistance program for disabled adults.The  hearing on Tuesday afternoon was so crowded that it quickly overflowed,  forcing the department to open two additional conference rooms and set  up phone lines to connect them all.The department decided last  year to reduce or cut payments to about 2,000 people in the program  after the Legislature cut about $45 million from the department's  overall budget. At the time, agency administrator Russ Barron said the  program, which served nearly 15,000 Idaho adults, faced a $1.1 million  deficit.But opponents say the cuts could force hundreds of  disabled Idahoans out of their certified family homes and into nursing  homes and other institutions, at a greater cost to the state and federal  government.Hearing officer Sandra Meikle will likely decide whether the cases should be dismissed or consolidated sometime in July.Charina  Newell, the attorney representing the department's Medicaid program  manager Alberto Gonzalez, said that Idaho law only requires the  department to make AABD payments if those funds are available. She said  Meikle doesn't have the authority to overrule the department's decision  to cut the funds, and that the hearing officer is required to show  deference to the department's interpretation of those rules as she  considers the case.Any appeals over the cuts should be handled in federal court, Newell said.But  Ritchie Eppink, an Idaho Legal Aid attorney representing about 110  people who are facing AABD cuts, said the administrative hearing was  exactly the place those claims should be considered, rather than  dragging everyone affected into federal court.""In fact, this is  probably the most economic forum for everybody involved,"" Eppink said.  ""The department asking that all these cases be turned into federal  cases? Obviously that could be done, but it would be exceedingly  expensive for all involved.""Eppink is already representing some  developmentally disabled clients in a potentially class-action lawsuit  in federal court, but he noted that the judge in that case has said  administrative hearings would be an appropriate step. Because the  federal lawsuit hasn't yet been certified as a class-action, right now  it doesn't cover everyone affected by the cuts, he said.Deanna Weaver, a legal guardian for three disabled adults, said the cuts posed a grave jeopardy to her wards' level of care.""All  three of them have extreme behaviors or are disabled,"" she said. ""They  can't go to the toilet by themselves. They can't cook for themselves.  They need a one-on-one or two-on-one ratio of caregivers - that  familiarity keeps them stable.""If her wards lose their AABD  payments and are institutionalized, they'll likely deteriorate, Weaver  said, because instead of having the same caregivers around the clock  they'll face a staff that changes with each shift.Alice Jane  Leitter, an AABD recipient who lives in a certified family home, said  that she doesn't have enough money to cover her room and board at her  certified family home without the payments. She fears she may be forced  to return to an institution.""I've been in six institutions, and I don't want to lose my home,"" Leitter said.But  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials say the cuts were  tailored to affect the fewest people in the smallest possible way.""Those  were very difficult decisions to make, but given the budget shortfalls""  the department had little choice, Gonzalez said after the hearing.Of  the 2,000 affected by the cuts, 1,400 lost payments altogether and 600  had their payments reduced, said department spokesman Tom Shanahan. The  payment reductions range from $33 a month to $198 a month for those who  live in certified family homes, and the money is intended to help cover  daily living expenses - the cost of medical care is generally handled  through separate programs."

Social Security Disability Benefits
Supplemental Security Income",,Supplemental Security Income,"WHAT IS SSI?

Go to http://www.ssa.gov, the Social Security Administration website, for an excellent explanation. SSI stands for the Supplemental Security Income program run by the federal government. SSI provides a monthly check for aged, blind, or disabled persons who are needy, and who can't work. SSI pays a low income individual $733 per month or a couple $1100 per month (as of 2015). You must have little money or property (up to $2,000 for a single person and $3,000 for a couple) along with being aged, blind, or disabled. Your house doesn’t count.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SSI AND SOCIAL SECURITY?

Social Security disability benefits are available for disabled workers who have paid in enough money to&nbsp;the Social Security fund over enough quarters to have insured status. SSI has no work history&nbsp;requirement. Some people who have a small amount of social security disability coverage will also be able to get a check for SSI.

WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY DISABLED?

The test for disability is the same for Social Security and SSI. Basically you must have a medical or&nbsp;mental health problem which keeps you from working full-time for at least a year. The Department of&nbsp;Health and Human Services, which runs the Social Security Administration, has rules and regulations&nbsp;which they use to define disability.

When you apply for disability, Social Security checks to see if you are working. People who work and earn over a certain amount per month ($1040.00 for 2013) are considered to be able to do ""substantial gainful activity"" (SGA) and they are denied disability. Social Security will look at the medical condition to see if it is ""severe."" A severe condition must be expected to result in death or last a year before they consider you disabled. There are 14 types of super severe conditions recognized by the Social Security Administration. If your condition matches any of the ones described in these 14 categories, you will qualify for benefits. If you have a severe impairment that does not match any of the 14 types of conditions, then the Social Security Administration will look at your age, education, and work experience to see if there is other work that you can do.

HOW TO APPLY

Any citizen or legal permanent resident can apply for SSI benefits at a local Social Security District Office.&nbsp;Call the following toll free number if you don't have a district office in your area and a service&nbsp;representative will assist you with the application. 1-800-772-1213.

A claims representative will assist you in filling out the application. You don't need to personally fill the&nbsp;entire form out. A friend or relative can help you, but you must sign it unless you are mentally or&nbsp;physically unable to sign your name. The application form asks information such as:


	when you last worked;
	the nature of your condition;
	what doctors and hospitals treated you;
	medications you are taking;
	information about income and resources.


The application form is sent to the Disability Determinations Service in Boise, who recommend disability&nbsp;decisions for the Social Security Administration.

MEDICAID

You are eligible for Medicaid if you qualify for SSI, but you must file a separate application. An application&nbsp;for Social Security or SSI is not an application for Medicaid. Medicaid is a government run medical&nbsp;insurance program that pays for medical care. You should apply for Medicaid at your local Idaho
Department of Health and Welfare Office at the same time as you apply for SSI.

HOW TO APPEAL

Most SSI disability applications are denied at first. If your application is denied you have 60 days to&nbsp;appeal. Forms are available at the local Social Security office for appealing. Social Security has informal&nbsp;hearings at the reconsideration level in some cases.&nbsp;If you are turned down at reconsideration, you can ask for a hearing in front of an administrative law&nbsp;judge (ALJ). The ALJs travel to Idaho on a monthly basis to hear cases. They will listen to your testimony
and your witnesses and review the evidence in your file. It usually takes six weeks to three months for&nbsp;them to issue a written decision. If they turn you down you may appeal to the Appeals Council in&nbsp;Washington D.C. and then to federal court.

DO YOU NEED AN ATTORNEY?

If you are denied disability benefits and feel that you are disabled, you should see an attorney. Idaho&nbsp;Legal Aid Services, Inc. represents hundreds of claimants for SSI disability. Your chances of winning an&nbsp;SSI appeal are much better if you have an attorney.

Here are 10 good reasons for getting an attorney:


	Your attorney knows the laws and regulations involved.
	Your attorney will help you get all the medical and other evidence that you need.
	Your attorney will contact your doctors and explain the requirements of the Social Security regulations.
	Your attorney will review the file Social Security has put together on your case and make sure it is
	complete.
	Your attorney will assist you with the special rules that apply to termination cases and overpayment
	cases and income or resource denials.
	Your attorney can seek a waiver of a time limit or seek to reopen a prior claim.
	Your attorney will prepare you to testify at your hearing.
	Your attorney can subpoena witnesses for your hearing and cross-examine experts that Social Security hires.
	Your attorney will argue for you at your hearing.
	Your attorney will review your hearing decision if you lose and help you appeal if it is necessary.

Living Wills
Other Wills/Estates
Probate",,Supplemental Security Income,"There are many decisions to be made every day in life, even late in life.  This is called life-time planning. Some of these decisions are of a financial  nature, while others are of a personal nature, and still others are  health-related. Financial decisions might include whether or not to have a joint bank  account, how to go about paying bills and arranging finances, and drafting and  maintaining legal papers. Personal decisions might include making funeral plans or burial arrangements,  choosing where to live, and fulfilling spiritual or religious preferences. Health decisions could include consenting to or refusing treatment, deciding  upon the course of treatment in case of terminal illness, and appointing someone  to make health care decisions for you should you become incapacitated. Each of us have the right to make our own choices and decisions based upon  our own values and our own desires, even if others disagree with us. Courts have  almost always followed the express wishes of competent adults. Therefore, it is  important to state your desires in writing about health decisions, financial  decisions, and personal decisions when you are clearly capable of expressing  those wishes. It is important to plan now for a possible period of your life  when your physical, medical, or mental conditions may require the involvement of  another individual to assist you with the activities of daily living. Some  questions you should consider when you begin planning for the future are:Who should you authorize to have access to your bank accounts or other    financial arrangements if you are not able to take care of them yourself?Who should you give authority to make health care decisions on your behalf    if you are unable to do so?At what point in your life should you authorize the people to take over    your financial and/or health care decision making?Ideally, we all should make lifetime plans when we are healthy and do not  need someone to make decisions for us. Practically speaking, many people do not  begin making lifetime plans at an early age. The objective of advanced planning  or lifetime planning is to maintain control over your life in the scenario that  you become impaired and are unable to maintain the control over your life that  you like to at that time. It is important to have someone ready and available to  step into your shoes should the time come. Shared Bank Accounts Most financial institutions have various options allowing more than one  person to have access over funds in a bank account. The most common type of  shared bank account is called a joint bank account. This allows two or  more people to deposit and withdraw money from the bank account. The persons  whose names are on the account do not need permission from the other to utilize  that bank account. If one of the account holders dies, the funds in the bank  account belong to the other individual. Before considering this type of  arrangement, you would need to fully trust the person(s) that you place on the  account. There are various disadvantages of joint ownership. For instance, the  person you list as the joint holder could withdraw all of the monies without  your permission or knowledge. In such an event, you probably would not ever be  able to recover those monies. Another disadvantage is that these types of accounts could negatively affect  the ability of you to access public benefits, such as Medicaid or the SSI  program. This is because programs such as Medicaid consider a joint bank account  to be 100 percent available to the Medicaid applicant. As a result, you could be  denied benefits, because it is assumed that you have more money in the bank than  is allowed. Where there is a significant amount of money involved, it is always best to  consult an attorney before setting up a joint bank account. For more  information, see "" Transfers of Property and Estate Planning"". Power of Attorney A durable power of attorney is a document by which one person (""principal"")  gives legal authority to another (""agent"") or (""attorney in fact"") to act on  his/her behalf. A power of attorney is a simple method to appoint someone that  you want to manage any part or all of your affairs. A power of attorney can be  very broad or it can be very limited. A limited power of attorney could grant  permission to another person to perform only certain acts, such as the authority  to sign a deed transferring a specific piece of real property to someone. A  broad power of attorney could enable the person to handle a broad range of  financial and personal affairs. A power of attorney can only be created when you  have the mental ability to know what the creation of the document means and that  you are acting at your own free will. It is advisable that you seek a durable power of attorney rather than a  regular power of attorney. A regular power of attorney is usually valid while  you have the mental capacity to inform your agent of your desires and to oversee  his/her actions. It becomes useless when you lose that ability and become  incapacitated. A durable power of attorney, on the other hand, survives  incapacity. A durable power of attorney indicates in the document that the power  of attorney will remain in effect despite the incompetence or incapacity of the  principal. A durable power of attorney is more useful than a regular power of  attorney, since the agent can continue to take care of your affairs after you  can no longer do so yourself. That is exactly when you need an agent to act  in your behalf--that is when you would need him or her the most.  A power of attorney can be effective as of the date of execution (the date it  is signed by the principal), or it can spring into effect at a future point in  time. Most powers of attorney spring into effect at a time when you have  determined that it should. This means that you could appoint someone today to be  your agent but his/her ability to act in your stead would only occur when a  certain event has taken place. The most common springing durable power of  attorney is that the one which would kick-in at such time as you became  incompetent or incapacitated. In those situations, language is usually included  that a physician would be required to provide a letter and attach it to the  durable power of attorney attesting to the incompetence or incapacity of that  individual. Remember, you can only create a power of attorney when you are of sound mind  or in a lucid interval. No one else can create a power of attorney for you or  sign a power of attorney for you. Thus, if you have never had an opportunity to  draft a durable power of attorney and you then become incompetent or  incapacitated and unable to manage your finances and affairs, this option is  unavailable and other courses of action may be necessary, such as guardian  and/or conservatorship. When creating a durable power of attorney it is  important to remember that you want to appoint someone who is extremely  trustworthy and someone who is willing and able to take on the responsibility of  managing your affairs. In Idaho, a durable power of attorney may not necessarily need to be  signed in front of a notary public when executed by the principal. A power of  attorney does not need to be recorded unless it is being used in  connection with a real estate transaction. If using the power of attorney in  connection with a real estate transaction, the power of attorney would need to be notarized. Therefore, it is always best to sign a power of attorney in  front of a notary. As you can see, there are great advantages to a durable power of attorney. By  carefully drafting a legal document that fits your needs when you are of sound  mind, you can be assured that you affairs will be taken care of, that bills will  be paid and that your general lifestyle will not be affected too much by your  inability to manage your own affairs. On the other hand, there is always the  possibility of being harmed by an untrustworthy agent. There is no mechanism in  Idaho which provides for a formal oversight of the agent. Therefore, if there is  no one you fully trust to act as your agent, don't use this important tool. On a side note, it is a good idea to put a gifting clause in your durable  power of attorney for the purposes of Medicaid and spousal impoverishment. This  is discussed further in the Chapter on Medicaid. Another clause that would be  helpful to have in a power of attorney is that the power of attorney shall not  be affected by lapse of time. Important points about Power of Attorney The person who gives a power of attorney to another person is called the   principal.The person appointed and authorized to use the power of attorney is called    the attorney-in-fact.It is best to sign a durable power of attorney before a notary. Unless it    is notarized it cannot be recorded, and unless it is recorded it cannot be    used to deal with real property. (See "" Transfers of Property"")The principal, by giving a power of attorney to the attorney-in-fact, does    not give up the right to continue transacting his or her own affairs.After it is signed, the original of the power of attorney should be given    to the attorney-in-fact. The attorney-in-fact may then give copies of it to    other parties, but should always retain the original. The principal should    also keep a copy.The attorney-in-fact may use the power of attorney only for the benefit of    the principal; the attorney-in-fact may not use the power of attorney for his    or her own benefit.Whenever signing a document for the principal, the attorney-in-fact should    sign as follows: ""[name of principal] by [name of attorney-in-fact] as    attorney-in-fact for [name of principal]."" For example, if Mary Smith has    given a power of attorney to her husband, John, then John should sign    documents when using the power of attorney as follows: ""Mary Smith by John    Smith as attorney-in-fact for Mary Smith.""A power of attorney may be revoked by the principal at any time by giving    written notice to the attorney-in-fact. If the power of attorney is recorded,    then the revocation must be recorded.If a power of attorney is a durable power of attorney it will    remain in effect, unless it explicitly states an earlier expiration, until the    principal revokes it or the principal dies. A durable power of attorney    contains the following or similar language: ""This power of attorney shall not    be affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of the principal."" If it is    not a durable power of attorney it will remain in effect, unless it explicitly    states an earlier expiration, until the principal revokes it or the principal    dies or the principal becomes mentally disabled or incompetent.A power of attorney need not be recorded at the county recorder's office    unless it is being used in connection with a real estate transaction.The attorney-in-fact is NOT financially responsible for the    principal's debts.A power of attorney ceases to be effective once the principal passes away. Durable Power Of Attorney For Health Care This document is similar to a durable power of attorney, but it is directed  exclusively to health care decisions and health care concerns. The power is  effective only when the principal is unable to communicate rationally.  Once again, the principal must be of sound mind or must at a time of lucid  interval, execute this document for himself. He can do so in front of a notary  public and/or two witnesses. By way of this document, the principal would  appoint someone he trusted to make any and all health care decisions and to  spell out some guidelines for those decisions. If the document is witnessed: the witness cannot be the person you designate as your agent or alternate    agenta healthcare provideran employee of a healthcare providerthe operator of a community care facilitythe employee of an operator of a community facility One of the greatest advantages of a durable power of attorney for healthcare  is not only that your health care wishes can be carried out to the fullest  extent, but it helps to relieve the potential stress of the conflict of decision  making for family, friends, and loved ones. It is important that when you choose your agent, you choose someone who is  willing and able to carry out your wishes. In addition, make sure he knows your  wishes, values, and preferences. It is best to put these in writing. Once  executed, a copy of this document should be provided to your health care  providers and should become part of your medical record. A durable power of attorney for health care is usually done at the same time  as a Living Will in order to implement the desires expressed therein. You can  revoke your durable power of attorney for health care and/or execute another  durable power of attorney for health care at any time as long as you are  competent to do so. Living Will In Idaho, there is one health care decision which the law requires that you  put in writing and that you do it at a time when you are of sound mind. This  document is a living will. This document is made regarding your wishes of the  use of life-prolonging medical care in the instance that you have an incurable  injury, disease, illness, or condition certified by two medical doctors, where  the application of artificial life-support will only prolong your life as death  is imminent, or you have been diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative  state. A living will must provide the directions and choices a person wishes.  Basically, an individual can choose to have: all medical treatment provided to him or her including all artificial    life-support procedures deemed necessaryno artificial life-support provided, but that food and water be provideddo nothing and let nature take its course  In all three options, you must be kept comfortable and free from pain. The  important things you want to think about prior to completing your living will is  whether or not you want artificial life support, and if not, whether or not you  want food and water provided to you at that time. Representative Payee Some government programs allow benefits payable to one person to be paid to  another person called a representative payee. Social Security, Railroad  Retirement, and the Veterans Administration programs all use representative  payees. The benefits are to be used for the person entitled to the money only. A representative payee can be appointed to you if you are unable to manage  the benefits you receive. You or someone on your behalf must apply to the agency  paying the benefits. A power of attorney will not work to endorse or cash  federal checks. It is not necessary to be legally incapacitated or incompetent to qualify for  a representative payee. If you do not want a representative payee or wish to  have another person serve as payee, you can ask the agency to change its  decision. The agency must review their decision to see whether or not you need a  payee. It is important to know that you have the right to challenge an agency's  decision to appoint a payee. A representative payee must account for the funds used and saved. They are  required to report this on a regular basis to the agency involved, usually on a  yearly basis. If the representative payee purposely misuses the funds, he/she  may be prosecuted. To get more information about representative payees, you  should contact the paying agency directly. Conservatorship A conservatorship is the legal proceeding that gives a person (the  conservator) power over the finances and estate of the incapacitated or  incapable person (the protected person). A conservatorship is established when  an individual or agency petitions the Court to have someone appointed to be  conservator for the alleged incapacitated person. You can designate the person  that you would want to be your conservator in the event that it become necessary  by stating that in a durable power of attorney. If you do state a person, the  Court can decide on a person that has priority and appointment him/her. Idaho requires that a petition be served on the protected person at least  fourteen (14) days prior to a hearing. A court visitor may be appointed by the  Court as well as a doctor who would both submit reports regarding the protected  person's physical and/or mental abilities as well as a recommendation as to  whether or not a conservatorship may be necessary. If the protected person does  not have counsel of his or her own, the Court may appoint an attorney to  represent him who has the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem. The Court will appoint a conservator if it finds that the protected person is  unable to manage his property and affairs effectively and that the person has  property which will be wasted or dissipated unless proper arrangement is  provided, or that funds are needed for the support, care, and welfare of the  person or those entitled to be supported by him and that protection is necessary  or desirable to obtain or provide funds. Once a conservator is appointed, the Courts in Idaho require that the  conservator file an inventory of the protected person within ninety (90) days of  the court appointment. The Court then requires that the conservator file a  yearly accounting with the Court. In that accounting, the conservator must tell  the Court how he/she has managed the finances and estate of the protected person  over the past year. An Inventory of Estate of Protected Person form and an  Annual Account of Ward's Estate form are located at the end of this chapter. The advantages of a conservatorship are that they are required to report to  the Court. In addition, the Court can impose a fine not to exceed $5,000 if the  Court finds that the conservator or guardian makes a substantial misstatement on  the required annual reports or is guilty of gross impropriety in handling the  property of the ward, or willfully fails to file the report within two (2)  months after having received notice to do so. The disadvantage of a  conservatorship is that it can be expensive and it requires a certain amount of  time to get put in place. In most cases, having in place the three advance  directives (durable power of attorney, durable power of attorney for health  care, and living will) can prevent the need for a conservatorship. This is not  always the case and there are always exceptions where a conservatorship and/or  guardianship may be necessary even though someone does have their advance  directives in place. A conservatorship can be terminated if the protected person is no longer  incapacitated or incapable of making financial decisions. A petition would need  to be filed with the Court to terminate the conservatorship. Likewise, the  conservator can petition the Court to have a particular conservator removed and  someone else substituted in as conservator. Idaho allows for a protective arrangement and single transactions without  acquiring the appointment of a conservator. In such an action the Court may  authorize or direct any transaction necessary or desirable to achieve any  security, services, or care arrangements meeting the foreseeable needs of the  protected person. Common examples include the establishment of a trust and  transactions involving real property. Guardianship A guardianship is the legal proceeding that gives a person (the guardian) the  power over all of the personal decision-making of the incapacitated person (the  ward). A guardian is appointed by the Court when the ward becomes incapacitated  or is in danger of serious physical injury or illness and is unable to make  decisions. A person interested in the welfare of another person may petition the  Court to become their guardian. The Court requires that a visitor be appointed to interview the proposed  ward, the petitioner, and the person who is nominated to serve as guardian. The  court visitor is to visit the abode of the ward and the place where it is  proposed he might soon be residing. The Court will also appoint a physician to examine the proposed ward. Both  are to provide reports to the attorneys of record and the Court with any written  recommendations. The Idaho Code create a list of priorities that will give guardianship to the  person who has the highest priority. However, the Court will look to a ward's  preference if the Court feels that it is in their best interests and they are  capable of making such a preference. Remember, a preference can be stated in a  durable power of attorney. The visitor will inquire of any preference. It is required that the ward receive notice of the petition and proceeding at  least fourteen (14) days prior to a hearing. In addition, the Court will appoint  an attorney to represent the alleged incapacitated person/ward. Once again, a  ward can object on the basis that he feels that he does not need a guardian  and/or that he wishes for someone else to be the guardian. The ward is entitled to be present at the hearing, to have legal counsel, to  submit evidence and testimony, and to examine the court-appointed visitor and  physician and all other witnesses. After a hearing, the Court can appoint an  individual as guardian upon a finding that the ward is unable to make or  communicate responsible decisions concerning his person and is otherwise  incapacitated. At such time, the Court would also issue Letters of Guardianship,  which is a Court paper showing the authority of the person named as guardian. The main role of a guardian is making personal decisions for the ward. If the  ward is unable to communicate, a guardian should try to make his/her decision  based on what is in the ward's best interest, or on what decisions the ward  would have made were (s)he able to do so. It is important that a guardian allow  the ward to participate in the decision making process as much as possible and  to the extent of his capabilities. The Idaho Legislature and the Courts in Idaho hold that the least restrictive  alternatives should be sought. Therefore, if a limited guardianship is all that  is needed, that is all that should be sought and that is all that the Court  should appoint. For example, a person may only need assistance in making medical  decisions. The guardianship could be limited for those areas only. In Idaho, an emergency guardianship can be sought ex-parte. There must be an  urgent situation which exists that will likely result in substantial harm to the  allegedly incapacitated person's health, safety, or welfare and no other person  appears to have authority to act. The petition should be supported by a doctor's  letter or other evidence indicating the urgency. The emergency guardianship must  be limited to only those powers absolutely necessary, or the least restrictive  to the proposed ward, for his or her immediate health and safety and until a  full hearing can be held. An appointment of temporary guardianship expires after  sixty (60) days. When a person needs help with all decision making, both of a personal nature  and a financial nature, a petition for guardian and conservator can be sought at  the same time. Just as with the conservatorship, guardianships can be terminated  upon petition to the Court and a finding that the ward is no longer  incapacitated or unable to make their own decisions regarding their personal  affairs. Likewise, a petition can be made to remove a particular guardian and  substitute that guardian with another person. It should be noted that although  not specifically set out in statute, the Courts will allow a successor guardian  to be named in a petition. This is most commonly used when an elderly spouse  petitions the Court to be guardian and/or conservator of their spouse. Because  of advanced age themselves, they may request at the same time that the Court  name a successor guardian in the event that they themselves should no longer be  able to carry out the duties and responsibilities of guardian and/or  conservator, become unwilling to do so, or predecease the ward/protected person. For more information see, ""The Guardianship and Conservatorship Handbook""  prepared by the Tax Probate and Trust Law Section of the Idaho State Bar, or a  pamphlet entitled, ""Serving as Guardian and Conservator"" prepared by the Idaho  Office on Aging in cooperation with the Idaho Department of Law Enforcement."

500,http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/1976,I-CAN! E-File Hits New High In Tax Refunds to Low-Income Americans,,,Taxation,"Washington,   DC—A free electronic tax filing system, launched with funding from the   Legal Services Corporation (LSC) eight years ago, has grown to include 560   partners in 49 states helping low-income workers apply for the Earned Income   Tax Credit (EITC). This   year, with about six weeks to go before the April 18 deadline for filing tax   returns, the free system, called I-CAN! E-File, has processed more than $110   million in EITC refunds and tax credits. The e-file project and a new website   to assist military veterans are among the ways that LSC-funded initiatives   provide access and information that help low-income Americans. “We   are in record territory at this point in the tax year,” said Robert J.   Cohen, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, a   nonprofit program funded by LSC that created the electronic filing system.   “This e-file system is an innovative and successful project that makes   a positive difference in the lives of low-income workers and their   families,” he said. I-CAN!   E-File and its partners promote the use of the free filing system and help   low-income Americans use the system in preparing their tax returns. Partners   include corporations, cities, credit unions and nonprofit organizations. This   year, the Legal Aid Society of Orange County has focused on community   colleges and libraries as key partners because they offer easy access to   computers, information and assistance for people preparing tax returns. I-CAN!   E-File takes its name from the Interactive Community Assistance Network, a   ground-breaking, self-help system developed by the Orange County, California,   program to provide low-income individuals and families with access to legal   forms and information. The website permits taxpayers at a fifth-grade   literacy level to log on, answer basic questions about their finances,   determine if they qualify for the EITC and then file their federal tax   returns online or print out their tax forms and mail them to the IRS. The   website for I-CAN! E-file (www.icanefile.org)   features a “live chat” function that allows website users to seek   assistance with navigating the site. Users exchange instant messages with the   website staff for help with passwords, screen displays and other web-related   issues. The EITC   is a refundable federal income tax credit for low- to moderate-income working   individuals and families approved by Congress in 1975 as a way to help offset   the burden of Social Security taxes and to provide an incentive to work. When   the EITC exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax refund to   those who claim and qualify for the credit. To qualify, taxpayers must meet   certain requirements and file a tax return, even if they did not earn enough   money to be obligated to file a return. The   I-CAN! E-file project receives funding from LSC’s Technology Initiative   Grants program, known as TIG. Since its inception in 2000, TIG has awarded   more than 450 grants, totaling more than $36 million, to support innovative   technology projects that improve services to clients, enhance efficiency at   LSC-funded programs and increase access to legal information. Glenn   Rawdon, who heads the TIG program, said the I-CAN! E-File project shows the   importance of TIG awards in leveraging resources to better serve low-income   Americans. “LSC’s newest TIG awards will make it easier for   veterans to seek disability benefits, for the public to obtain legal   information and for Spanish-speaking persons to apply for civil legal   assistance,” he said. LSC   is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that receives an annual   appropriation from Congress to promote equal access to justice and to provide   for high-quality civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and   families. LSC funds go to 136 nonprofit legal aid programs across the country   that provide legal services to persons at or below 125 percent of the federal   poverty guideline."

At any time before death, the testator may still give away or sell her property. The testator may also amend or revoke her will or put in effect an entirely new will at any time before her death, as long as she is mentally competent to do so.

We plan for retirement, a wedding, vacations, and for a child’s education. Sadly, the health choices that are made at the end of life are seldom planned and many times they are made for us. Decisions are put off and desires are not expressed because it is difficult to contemplate or discuss death. There are many things to plan for at the end of life. Transfer of property and the well being of a spouse or child are all issues to be considered and planned for. However, the topic discussed here involves end of life health care issues, the importance of living wills, and advance directives. The principle way to ensure that your desires are fulfilled if you are no longer able to communicate your wishes is through a Living Will."

An interactive form is available for free to seniors and low income Idaho residents collecting personal property of decedents who lived in Idaho and had no plans to go and make their primary residence somewhere else at the time of their deaths. It could be used by non-Idaho residents or to collect property of people who did not die in Idaho or live in Idaho when they died, but only in certain circumstances that might or might not apply in your case. In such a case, you should probably consult with an attorney before completing and using an Affidavit Collecting Property.

An Affidavit Collecting Property is only appropriate if the fair market value of the decedent’s entire estate (wherever the property might be)—after all liens and debts on the property are deducted—is no more than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).

The information you will need to complete the Affidavit Collecting Personal Property interview includes:


	A copy of the decedent’s death certificate to attach to the affidavit. This will provide most of the information you will need to generate this affidavit.
	The name of the county where the affidavit will be signed.
	The name of any person who will sign the affidavit. (These must be people entitled to receive the property under a will or Idaho’s intestacy statutes.)
	Names of those entitled to receive the personal property of the decedent and the proportion or amount of the property they are to receive.

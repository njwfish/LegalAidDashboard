",Attorneys / Legal Services,"Do you have a legal problem and wonder whether you could handle it yourself without hiring a lawyer?

There aren't enough free legal services in New Mexico to help everyone who needs help. But you might be able to manage your legal problem without a lawyer.

New Mexico’s legal services programs have created a ""Can I Do It Myself"" interview tool to help you think about whether you could handle your legal problem without a lawyer.

The ""Can I Do It Myself"" interview is geared towards Landlord-Tenant situations, but is not going to teach you about Landlord-Tenant law. There is a separate website&nbsp;with information about Landlord-Tenant law.

The interview helps you think about issues like:


	would you be able to get to court on time,
	are you willing to read information about the legal issues involved,
	how you manage your time,
	how well you can read legal paperwork,
	how well you manage stressful situations


The interview might take about 20 minutes. It will ask about things like:


	How far you got in school,
	How much you use the internet,
	How comfortable you are using the English language.
	Why we ask questions like this … The questions and your answers may point to useful skills that will help you with your legal issue or highlight things that could come up if your problem got to court


At the end of the interview, you will be able to save and print out a summary sheet to help you with your next steps.

We hope you will give this interview a try. We also hope you will give us feedback so we can improve the questions and make the interview useful. &nbsp;All comments and suggestions welcome. You can send your thoughts and comments by email to the project at nmformstesting (at) gmail.com.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Use of this service does not guarantee that Law Access New Mexico, New Mexico Legal Aid or any other legal services program will be able to accept your case or help you directly. It also does not establish an attorney-client relationship with any attorney working for a New Mexico legal services program.

18,http://www.lawaccess.org/node/99,I want to get a divorce in New Mexico,Family,,Family Law,"What do I have to do to begin the divorce process in New Mexico?

1) &nbsp;Establish residency – Establishing residency means that either you or your spouse must have lived in New Mexico at least six months before filing for divorce, regardless of where you were married.

2) &nbsp;Complete the paperwork - Some courts have a ""divorce packet"" that can be purchased for a fee from the District Court Clerk’s Office. If the court does not have a packet for sale, then attorneys at Law Access New Mexico may be able to help prepare the divorce paperwork for you. Call Law Access New Mexico at 1-800-340-9771 to complete an intake and find out additional information.

3) &nbsp;Pay the filing fee - Before divorce papers can be filed, a fee has to be paid to the District Court. &nbsp;If you cannot afford the fee and other costs, you may ask the District Court for “free process.” &nbsp;Depending on which judicial district court you file with, either the entire amount or a portion of the fee and costs may be waived. &nbsp;The District Court Judge makes the final decision as to whether you qualify for free process.

4) &nbsp;Certify service of process - Once you complete the paperwork in the packet and file the paperwork with the District Court, your spouse must be given the necessary papers by someone other than yourself who is over the age of 18 and not a party to your case. &nbsp;The person who gives (or “serves”) your spouse the papers must complete a form included in the divorce packet which essentially states that he/she gave your spouse the papers. Make sure that the person serving your spouse lists all of the documents that your spouse is served with. &nbsp;That form must be filed with the District Court. &nbsp;It is okay for you to file the form; however, the person who served your spouse must complete the form.

What does my spouse have to do after he/she receives the Petition for Dissolution?

Once your spouse is served with the divorce paperwork, your spouse has thirty (30) days to file a Response (or “Answer”) with the court. &nbsp;Whether your spouse agrees with what you requested or not, your spouse needs to file an Answer. &nbsp;The Answer is your spouse’s chance to tell the court his/her side of what you have said in the Petition.

If your spouse agrees with everything you have said in the Petition for Dissolution and if there are no issues to be decided by the District Court (such as how the property should be divided or child custody), then you and your spouse can sign a Marital Settlement Agreement and prepare a

Final Decree (also part of the divorce packet) for the court.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Marital Settlement Agreement must be signed and notarized by both you and your spouse and then filed with the District Court. The divorce will often be finalized in a matter of days; however, that depends on where the divorce was filed.

What happens if my spouse does not file an Answer or Response?

If after 30 days from receiving the Petition, your spouse has not filed an Answer or Response, you may ask the District Court for a Default Judgment. &nbsp;In order to do that, you have to prove that you have filed all of the necessary paperwork, including proof that your spouse was given the Petition for Dissolution.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the District Court gives you a Default Judgment, usually everything&nbsp; you&nbsp; asked&nbsp; for&nbsp; in&nbsp; your&nbsp; Petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; Dissolution&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; given&nbsp; to&nbsp; you.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Default judgments are not granted if your spouse convinces the court that he/she had a good excuse for not filing an Answer or Response within 30 days.

What is community property?


	Real estate bought during the marriage and maybe some property bought before the marriage but used for the community.
	Things bought during the marriage by either you or your spouse (regardless of whether you or your spouse paid for or used the item).&nbsp; Even if title to the item is not in both your name and your spouse’s name, New Mexico law assumes that the item is community property.
	Income that you or your spouse earned during the marriage.
	Many retirement, pension, and disability benefits.


What is separate property?


	Property that you owned before you were married and that you have kept in your own name throughout the marriage.
	Property you inherited or received as a gift, either before or after you were married.
	Property you and your spouse have agreed is separate property.
	Property you or your spouse gets after legally separating but before divorcing, under certain circumstances.
	Certain veteran’s benefits.

"
19,http://www.lawaccess.org/node/100,I want to learn about child custody issues in New Mexico,Family,,Family Law,"How does a judge decide custody of a child?

In New Mexico the judge looks at what is best for the child.&nbsp; The judge assumes it is best that both parents are involved and participate in the child’s life.&nbsp; The judge looks at many things, including how the child has adjusted to his/her home, school, and community.&nbsp; If the judge learns that one parent has an issue that makes it difficult to fully participate in the child’s life, the judge can consider giving sole custody to the other parent.&nbsp; Such issues include: drug or alcohol addiction; criminal record; incarceration; and the health of the parent, spouse, or significant other of the parent.

What is legal custody?

Legal custody addresses both parents’ responsibilities for the child, including the child’s financial, physical, emotional and developmental needs.&nbsp; It concerns each parent’s authority to make important decisions regarding their child on issues like where the child lives, health care, education, religion, and recreation.&nbsp;

What is joint legal custody?

“Joint” legal custody means both parents have to work together to make the best decisions on these issues for their child.&nbsp; Joint legal custody is what the courts in New Mexico most often order.&nbsp;

What is sole legal custody?

“Sole” legal custody means that only one parent is responsible for most of the child’s needs.&nbsp; It also means that only one parent will make the important decisions regarding the child.&nbsp; It does NOT mean that the other parent cannot have contact or visitation with the child.

If a parent requests sole legal custody, that parent will need to give reasons why joint legal custody is not appropriate.&nbsp; Even if one parent lives in a different town than the child and only sees the child during holidays or summer vacations, that parent could still be given joint custody.

What is physical custody?

Physical custody refers to the time the child spends with each parent.&nbsp; Physical custody arrangements can be quite different from family to family depending upon what the judge thinks the children of the family need.&nbsp; Physical custody arrangements can range from one parent having the child most of the time and the other parent only seldom having time with the child, to an arrangement where the parents each have the child half of the time.

If the parents both have some physical custody of the child, does that mean that both parents have to pay the same amount of child support?

No.&nbsp; Child support is based on many different things, including how much each parent earns and the amount of time the child spends with each parent.&nbsp; For more information regarding child support, see information sheet #382-Child Support.

What is sole physical custody?

Sole physical custody is a somewhat unusual arrangement where the child lives with one parent all the time and the other parent only has minimum visitation with the child.&nbsp; It is also possible that the judge will decide that the best interest of the child requires that the visitation be supervised.

If sole legal custody is given to one parent, does that mean that the other parent can never see his/her child?

Not usually.&nbsp; If a judge believes the child will be hurt or is in danger when in the care of the other parent, the judge can order supervised visitation.&nbsp; Usually, the Court orders visitation or time-sharing for the non-custodial parent.&nbsp; The circumstances have to be fairly extreme for a court to not let a parent see his/her child at all.

What is a parenting plan?

It is a court document that controls how certain issues regarding the child will be handled.&nbsp; Every plan is different and depends on what agreements are made by the parties.&nbsp; If the parents cannot reach an agreement, a judge will make the parenting decisions for the parents.&nbsp; Most plans include statements that explain: (1) when the child will stay with each parent and for how long (often called periods of responsibility); (2) which holidays the child will stay with each parent; (3) when, how, and where the child will be transferred from one parent to the other; (4) how decisions about the child’s education, religion, and medical care will be made; (5) how to handle disagreements about the parenting plan; and (6) child support and any other issues that will help make joint custody work for both parents and the child.&nbsp; All parenting plans need to be approved by a judge.&nbsp; Parenting plans cannot be filed with the Court without first opening a case.

What happens if my child’s other parent is not doing what the parenting plan says?

Because a judge approves a parenting plan, it becomes a court order.&nbsp; A parent who doesn’t follow the parenting plan could be violating a court order.&nbsp; The non-violating parent could file a Motion to Enforce or Motion for Order to Show Cause with the court.&nbsp; Blank forms for both Motions are available at some District Courts.&nbsp; Once the issue is brought before a judge, the judge will decide whether the order has been violated and what the consequences will be for the violating parent.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; Some parenting plans require both parties to attend mediation or family counseling for disagreements about the parenting plan before getting a judge involved.&nbsp; If your parenting plan requires that, it is important to follow what was agreed or ordered.&nbsp; It is best to send a letter to the other parent, formally requesting mediation.&nbsp; That way you have proof to show to the court that you tried to get the other parent to attend mediation, and they refused.

If my child’s other parent doesn’t pay child support, does he/she still get to see our child?

Yes.&nbsp; Child support and visitation are two separate issues and should not depend on each other.&nbsp; If one parent doesn’t allow the other parent to visit with the child because child support hasn’t been paid, both parents have violated the judge’s orders.&nbsp; The correct action is to file a Motion for Order to Show Cause against the parent who is not paying child support or against the parent who is refusing to allow the other parent access to the child.

Will the judge ask my child’s opinion about where he/she wants to live?

Judges will not make a child choose between two parents, even if the child wants to give his/her opinion. Also, judges will not consider what the child wants until the child is at least 14 years old.&nbsp; Once a child is 14 years of age or older, the court may consider what the child wants but there is no guarantee that the court will agree with the child.&nbsp; The main issue the judge has to look at, regardless of the child’s age, is what is best for the child.&nbsp; If a parent has concerns that the child’s best interest is getting lost in the court process, that parent can petition the court to appoint a Guardian Ad Litem.&nbsp; A Guardian Ad Litem is an attorney for the child, and the parents usually share the cost of paying the Guardian Ad Litem's fees.&nbsp; This attorney advocates what is best for the child.&nbsp; It’s possible that the Guardian Ad Litem will not agree that what the child wants is in his/her best interest.&nbsp; This attorney should still tell the judge how the child feels.

I am not happy with the parenting plan.&nbsp; How can it be changed?

If both parents are able to agree to a change, the agreement needs to be put in writing, signed by both parents, notarized, and filed with the court.&nbsp; If both parents can’t agree, a judge usually will not change a parenting plan unless there has been a “material change in circumstances.”&nbsp; That means that something important has changed in your life, your child’s life, or the other parent’s life.&nbsp; Even if a “material change” has happened, the judge will not make any changes to the parenting plan unless the judge believes it will be in your child’s best interest.&nbsp; The type of changes that a judge will look at before deciding to modify a parenting plan include (but are not limited to) marriage, moving to another town, or major illness.&nbsp; Minor changes in a person’s life, such as minor work changes, moving a short distance, or lack of convenience usually don’t make it necessary to change a parenting plan.

20,http://www.lawaccess.org/node/101,I want to learn about child support in New Mexico,Family,,Family Law,"How does a judge decide how much child support has to be paid?

At a child support hearing, a judge or hearing officer fills out a worksheet with information about:&nbsp; (1) the amount of money both parents earn before taxes; (2) medical/dental insurance premiums that are paid for the child(ren); (3) work-related child care costs; (4) the number of children involved; and (5) how much time each child spends with each parent.&nbsp; Once the information is entered on the worksheet, the judge or hearing officer follows objective guidelines that all courts in New Mexico use to determine how much child support each parent has to pay.&nbsp;

You can get an estimate of what child support in your situation might be from HERE. Click on ""Child Support Worksheet"".

Before a court hearing to consider child support, many courts send both parents a list of financial documents that have to be brought with them to court.&nbsp; It is important that all of the documents and any other listed information be brought to the hearing and told to the judge or commissioner.&nbsp; Some of the documents that must be brought include current pay stubs and receipts for childcare and health insurance. Some medical bills might be entered on the worksheet.&nbsp; If you aren’t sure, bring your documentation to court anyway and ask the judge.

IMPORTANT!!!!&nbsp; Amounts paid for mortgages or rent, utilities, car payments, or credit card accounts will not be entered on the worksheet.&nbsp;

Do I have to keep receipts for how child support is spent?

No.&nbsp; Although child support payments should be used for the living expenses of the child, how the money is spent is up to the parent receiving the child support, and no receipts are required.&nbsp;

If my child’s other parent doesn’t pay the amount of child support ordered by the court, does he/she still get to see our child?

Yes.&nbsp; Child support and visitation are two separate issues and should not depend on each other.&nbsp; If one parent doesn’t allow the other parent to visit with the child because child support hasn’t been paid, both parents have violated the court orders.&nbsp; (The parent who will not let the child visit the other parent has violated the Parenting Plan or Visitation Order; the parent who does not pay child support has violated the Child Support Order.)

My child’s other parent keeps quitting his/her job to avoid paying child support.&nbsp; Does he/she not have to pay anything?

Even if a parent is unemployed, a judge will often find out how much money he/she earned at his/her last job or the amount he/she is capable of earning (called imputed income) and enter that amount on the worksheet.&nbsp; Even though he/she isn’t working, that parent would still be required to pay the amount of money he/she would be earning if working.&nbsp; It is important to let the judge know what you believe is happening.&nbsp; This type of situation makes collecting the money difficult, but not impossible.

My child’s other parent hasn’t paid child support as ordered by the court.&nbsp; What can I do?

A “Motion to Enforce” or “Motion for Order to Show Cause” may be filed with the court.&nbsp; Blank forms for both Motions are available at some District Courts.&nbsp; Once the issue is brought before a judge, the judge will decide whether the order has been violated and what the consequences will be and could order that the non-paying parent spend time in jail.&nbsp;

A Request for Wage Withholding may also be filed with the court if the other parent is employed.&nbsp; This process is best set up by working with the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED). The way this works is that once a Wage Withholding Order is granted by the court, the employer of the parent owing child support is required to deduct a certain amount from that parent’s pay check each pay period.&nbsp; The amount deducted is then sent to the receiving parent.&nbsp; Once an order has been issued, it will stay in place regardless of whether the paying parent changes jobs.&nbsp; CSED will automatically forward a Notice to Withhold to the new employer.

Also, working through CSED, a driver’s licenses may be denied or suspended if the person ordered to pay child support has failed to do so and state and federal tax refunds may be withheld if child support payments are not paid as ordered.

My child’s other parent and I were never married.&nbsp; Does he/she still have to pay child support?

Yes.&nbsp; But paternity has to be established first

When and how can a child support order be changed?

If both parents agree to the change, the agreement should be put in writing, signed, notarized, and filed with the court.&nbsp; The agreement should state the new amount of child support, when the change will take effect and for how long.&nbsp; It is usually best to follow the child support guidelines because the court may still deny the agreement that was reached by the parents if there is not a good reason that the guidelines were not followed.

If an agreement between the parents cannot be reached, a Motion to Modify Child Support can be filed with the court.&nbsp; The same procedure as when the original Child Support Order was made will be followed, including providing the same documents to complete the worksheet.&nbsp; A judge may modify the amount of child support to be paid “upon a showing of material and substantial changes in circumstances” which occurred after the court entered its last child support order.&nbsp; For example, a change in the financial situation of one or both parents or a change in the amount of time a child spends with one parent may be considered a material and substantial change in circumstances.&nbsp; A “material and substantial change in circumstances” is presumed if:&nbsp; (1) there is a change upward or downward of more than 20% of the existing child support obligation after applying the child support guidelines, and (2) if the petition for modification is filed more than one year after the filing of the pre-existing Child Support Order.&nbsp;

21,http://www.lawaccess.org/node/102,Tell me about alimony (spousal support) in New Mexico,Family,,Family Law,"What is the difference between spousal support and alimony?

There is no legal difference between them.&nbsp;

How does a judge decide whether to order one spouse to pay alimony to the other?

A judge will look at many different things, including:&nbsp; (1) the age and health of both spouses; (2) both spouses’ ability to support themselves; (3) how much each spouse earns now and in the future; (4) how well each spouse tries and is able to support him/herself; (5) how long the marriage lasted; (6) how much each spouse owes; and (7) how both spouses lived during the marriage.

Does alimony have to be paid on a monthly basis?

No.&nbsp; Alimony may be paid in a lump sum or in regular payments, however the spouses must agree on the payment method or a judge will issue an order.

What can alimony be spent on?

If the judge says that alimony has to be spent on certain things, then the alimony has to be spent on those things.&nbsp; Sometimes a judge will say that alimony must be used for school or job training so that the spouse who gets the alimony will be able to get a job and support him/herself.&nbsp; Sometimes a judge will say that alimony just be given to the other spouse in addition to money he/she earns, and the spouse receiving the alimony can decide how the money is spent.&nbsp; If the judge does not say anything about how the alimony is to be spent, the money may be spent however the spouse receiving the alimony wants.

How long do you have to be married to request alimony?

Anyone can request alimony.&nbsp; However, courts do not usually award alimony for short marriages.&nbsp; As a general rule, a marriage under 10 years would most likely be considered short.&nbsp; However, it really depends on the circumstances of the marriage and other factors listed above as to whether or not a judge will order alimony.&nbsp; In New Mexico, if you have been married for over 20 years, the court will automatically consider whether alimony is appropriate in your case.&nbsp; It is always best to ask for alimony if you believe that your circumstances might fit within the legal guidelines for making an alimony award.

How long does a spouse have to pay alimony?

It depends on what the parties agree to or what a judge orders.&nbsp; It can be for a specific time, until a certain event occurs (such as remarriage), or until the spouse receiving the alimony dies.

4317 Lead SE Suite A
Albuquerque NM 87108
(505) 265-2300

Grandparents serve an important role in the lives of grandchildren.&nbsp; Most parents encourage grandparent involvement.&nbsp; However, sometimes a parent blocks visitation by a grandparent.&nbsp; Although U.S. law strongly supports the right of parents to raise their children without interference, in very limited circumstances the law overrides parental decisions.

A New Mexico law[1] gives grandparents a limited right to ask the court for visitation.&nbsp; A grandparent may use the law only if:


	A divorce, legal separation or determination of parenthood case has been opened; or,
	One or both of the child’s parents are deceased; or,
	The child lived with the grandparent for a period of at least three months while the child was under six years old, and someone removed the child from the grandparent’s home; or,
	The child lived with the grandparent for a period of at least six months while the child was six years of age or older, and someone removed the child from the grandparent’s home; or
	The child is the subject of an adoption proceeding.


A grandparent whose situation falls into one of the categories above may petition the court for visitation rights.&nbsp; The court may refer the matter to mediation.&nbsp; The court will allow visitation only if it is in the best interest of the child, and shall consider the following factors in reaching its decision:


	Any factors relevant to the best interests of the child;
	The relationship of the grandparent and the child;
	The relationship of the grandparent and the child’s parents;
	Established visitation arrangements;
	The effect of the grandparent’s visitation on the child;
	If the grandparent has any convictions for abuse or neglect;
	If the grandparent served as full-time caretaker of the child.


If a court grants grandparents visitation rights, the child’s custodian must provide the grandparent with notice of any move within or outside of New Mexico and provide the new address and phone number of the child.

Even if the court does not order visitation, it may order reasonable contact between the grandparent and grandchild, such as by telephone or mail.

54,http://www.lawaccess.org/node/140,I want to get guardianship of a child,Family,,Family Law,"In New Mexico, non-parents can ask to become kinship-guardians of a child (or children) when the parents are not able to care for the child (or children).

What does Kinship mean?
“The relationship that exists between a child and a relative of the child, a godparent, a member of the child’s tribe or clan, or an adult with whom the child has a significant bond.” Keep reading for more in depth information on Kinship Guardianship questions.

This section explains who can become legal guardian of a child under the Kinship Guardianship Act, and what conditions must be in place in order for a judge to appoint a person as kinship guardian of a child.

What does “legal guardianship” mean?
Legal guardianship suspends the rights of a child’s parents and transfers most of those rights to the legal guardian.

How long does legal guardianship of a child last?
If the judge appoints you as temporary legal guardian of a child the guardianship will remain in effect for six months. If you are appointed as the child’s legal guardian and the order does not state that the guardianship is temporary, the guardianship will last until the child turns 18 or until a judge revokes the guardianship.

How do I go about getting legal guardianship of a child who is living with me?
To become the legal guardian of a child whose parents are not deceased you must file a Petition for Kinship Guardianship in the district court where you and the child live. For more detailed information about the legal process call the Guardianship Legal Helpline: in the Albuquerque area call (505) 217-1660; Statewide call 1-800-980-1165.

If the child’s parents consent to the guardianship do I still have to file a petition with the court?
Yes. In order to be appointed as the legal guardian of a child you must file a petition with the court. If the child’s parents agree you can have them sign a consent form and file it with the court, but you must still go through the court proceeding become the child’s legal guardian.

Can I still be appointed as kinship guardian of my grandchild even if the parents do not agree?
Yes, under certain conditions you can be appointed kinship guardian of a child even if the child’s parents do not agree. Those conditions are:
The child has been living with you for at least 90 days AND
The parent who objects to the guardianship has not lived in the home with you during that time AND
You are able to prove to the judge that the parent is unable or unwilling to provide proper care for the child AND
It is in the child’s best interests that you be appointed as her kinship guardian.

Can I be appointed as kinship guardian of a child even if I am not related to her by blood?
Yes. To qualify to be the kinship guardian of a child you must have a close bond with the child, but you do not need to be related by blood.

How do I go about revoking the guardianship?
If you and the parent or parents agree that it is time to revoke the guardianship you can file a motion with the court asking to have the guardianship revoked. The judge will most likely want you to appear in court to explain why revocation of the guardianship is in the child’s best interests.

What can I do to keep my grandchild safe if she is in danger now?
If you believe that your grandchild is at risk of abuse and/or neglect you should call the police or child protective services. The process of getting legal guardianship of a child usually takes at least 90 days. Under certain circumstances you may be able to file for guardianship on an emergency basis. Call the Guardianship Legal Helpline: in the Albuquerque area call (505) 217-1660; Statewide call 1-800-980-1165.

Can I file for guardianship myself or do I need a lawyer?
You do not need a lawyer to apply for guardianship. You can go to your local district court and ask for the forms to file for kinship guardianship of a child, or you can call the Guardianship Legal Helpline. The Guardianship Legal Helpline can help you determine if you want to file by yourself, and if you do, help you with questions and the paperwork. In the Albuquerque area call (505) 217-1660, Statewide call 1-800-980-1165.

Is there help for me if I need help but can’t afford a lawyer?
Yes. There are two agencies in New Mexico that specialize in helping grandparents and others get kinship guardianship of children living with them. Pegasus Legal Services for Children provides legal representation in guardianship cases where one or more of the parents does not agree to the guardianship. Another agency, Advocacy, Inc. handles cases where the parents agree to the guardianship. Call the Guardianship Legal Helpline to get more information and find out which agency is the right one to help you. In the Albuquerque area call (505) 217-1660; Statewide call 1-800-980-1165.

122,http://www.lawaccess.org/node/210,Protect SNAP Benefits for New Mexico Families,Public Benefits,,Food Programs,"Join with communities from across the state to tell Governor Martinez and Human Services Department Secretary Sidonie Squier to protect SNAP benefits for all New Mexicans.

The Governor has proposed to turn down federal resources and implement work requirements for SNAP participants. Without child care, job training and job readiness support, and almost non-existent public transportation in rural parts of the state, New Mexicans dealing with some of the fewest job prospects and highest food insecurity in the nation are telling the governor and Human Services Deparment secretary Sidonie Squier that these changes will only hurt New Mexico families.


	47% of SNAP Participants are in working families
	SNAP benefits are 100% paid for by the federal government
	Every $1 of food assistance given through SNAP goes directly into local food and grocery stores, creating $1.70 to $1.80 in economic activity.
	New Mexico could lose over $47 million funneled directly into our poorest counties.
	New Mexico is one of the most food insecure states in the nation - 1 in 5 New Mexicans and 1 in 3 children struggle to afford a nutritionally adequate diet.
	20.8% of New Mexicans live below the poverty line, including 29.2% of children. 86% of this population participates in the SNAP program.
